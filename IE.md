## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about Identity Essentials.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s dive in—when you think about identity in marketing these days, why is it such a big deal for brands? What’s actually changed to make it so crucial?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that’s a good one. Honestly, identity is at the heart of everything now. People expect more from brands—think about how spoiled we are by Amazon, Netflix, or Spotify. The bar’s really high.

**Interviewer**: Right, it’s almost like if a brand doesn’t recognize you, you feel... what, invisible?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Customers want to be seen as real people, not just a number or some random device. And it doesn’t matter if they’re shopping online, in a store, or jumping back and forth between both.

**Interviewer**: And it’s not just about recognizing them, right? There’s the whole privacy thing now too.

**Interviewee**: Yes, totally. With new privacy laws and third-party cookies going away, brands can’t just track people like they used to. So, getting identity right isn’t optional anymore—it’s survival.

**Interviewer**: Survival, wow. So if you can’t connect those dots, you’re in trouble?

**Interviewee**: Pretty much. If you don’t know who your customers are, you’re just throwing money away. You miss chances to connect, and you end up annoying people with stuff they don’t care about.

**Interviewer**: So that’s why identity is the centerpiece now. Makes sense. But—

**Interviewee**: You’re going to ask what the hard part is, right? Like, what’s actually getting in the way?

**Interviewer**: Yeah! Because it sounds simple—just connect the dots. But it can’t be that easy.

**Interviewee**: Not at all. The biggest headache is data being all over the place. Customer info lives in a bunch of different systems—websites, apps, stores, call centers. Every touchpoint might think you’re someone new.

**Interviewer**: So it’s like you have ten versions of the same customer, but none of them are really... correct?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And people switch devices, use different emails, sometimes shop totally anonymously. It’s a puzzle.

**Interviewer**: Plus, you have to think about all the privacy rules. That’s got to make things even trickier.

**Interviewee**: It does. There’s consent management, privacy regulations—it’s a minefield. And if you get it wrong, you end up with broken journeys, wasted ad spend, and zero real personalization.

**Interviewer**: So without the right identity solution, it’s just chaos.

**Interviewee**: Total chaos. But get it right, and everything clicks.

**Interviewer**: Okay, that sets the stage really nicely—so, uh, let’s dig into Identity Essentials. Can you explain, in simple terms, what it actually is? And, you know, how does it help brands sort out all these identity headaches?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, so, Identity Essentials is Epsilon’s answer to that whole messy, fragmented customer identity problem. Picture it as this portable identity and data toolkit—powered by something called CORE ID.

**Interviewer**: CORE ID? That sounds fancy. What does it actually do?

**Interviewee**: Right, so imagine all those scattered data points—devices, emails, stuff online, stuff offline—Identity Essentials pulls all that together. It basically stitches everything into one connected, persistent view of each customer.

**Interviewer**: So, like, if I’m browsing anonymously on a website, then later I open an email, or maybe shop in-store…

**Interviewee**: Exactly, the brand can finally recognize you as the same person in all those places.

**Interviewer**: That’s wild. And it just fits into whatever marketing system a brand’s already using?

**Interviewee**: Yep, it plugs right in. It helps personalize experiences, lets you measure what’s working, and—most importantly—stops you from wasting money on, you know, those annoying, irrelevant messages.

**Interviewer**: So it’s like… giving your marketing team a pair of glasses, so they can finally see who’s who.

**Interviewee**: That’s a perfect way to put it. Suddenly, everything’s clearer.

**Interviewer**: You mentioned, uh, data fragmentation and broken journeys. Can you walk us through a real example? Maybe how this actually shows up for a brand—and how Identity Essentials fixes it?

**Interviewee**: Sure thing. Picture a retail brand. Someone browses shoes on their phone, then later signs up for a loyalty card in-store—but with a different email. Maybe they even abandon a cart online, get a promo email, and finally buy those shoes in the store.

**Interviewer**: So, the brand might think all those actions are from different people?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! That’s when you get redundant emails, irrelevant ads, just a clunky customer experience.

**Interviewer**: Which nobody wants.

**Interviewee**: Right. But with Identity Essentials, all those data points—emails, device IDs, purchase history—get matched up to a single profile. So next time that customer shows up, online or in-store, the brand knows who they are and what they like.

**Interviewer**: And then they can personalize everything—offers, messages, the whole experience.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it turns chaos into order. And shoppers into, well, loyal fans.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so you gave us the big picture earlier, but can we go a little deeper? What are the core building blocks of Identity Essentials—like, what are the main parts, and how do they actually fit together to solve those pain points you mentioned?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, let’s get into it! So, Identity Essentials is really made up of a few key components that all work in tandem. First up, there’s Resolution & Hygiene. This is kind of your... I don’t know, your clean-up crew and your puzzle solver, right?

**Interviewer**: Puzzle solver—love that. What does it actually do?

**Interviewee**: Well, it takes all your messy data—emails, device info, even offline stuff like postal addresses—and stitches it together. So instead of five different fragments for the same person, you get one, unified profile.

**Interviewer**: Oh, so it’s like merging all your duplicate contacts into one, but way smarter?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And then there’s Contact Complete, which is all about filling in the blanks. If you’re missing info, it enriches those profiles, so you’re not just sending messages into the void.

**Interviewer**: So it fills in the gaps, basically.

**Interviewee**: Right. And the last piece is TotalSource Plus—think of it as the data backbone. It’s constantly updating and refreshing your info, so your profiles are always current.

**Interviewer**: So, these different parts—they’re all talking to each other behind the scenes?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly. When someone interacts with you, whether it’s online or in the real world, you get a single, unified view of them. That means you can personalize in real-time, actually measure what’s working, and avoid those awkward, wasteful moments.

**Interviewer**: Okay, let’s dig into Resolution & Hygiene for a second. How does it actually work? What kind of messy data does it tackle, and what does that mean for marketers day to day?

**Interviewee**: So, think of Resolution & Hygiene as both the janitor and the detective of your data. It grabs all the raw info—emails, names, phone numbers, addresses—and matches them up, so you don’t have five versions of the same person floating around.

**Interviewer**: And it actually cleans up typos and stuff, right?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it fixes typos, updates addresses—using things like CASS and NCOA—and even flags folks who shouldn’t be contacted. People who’ve opted out, deceased customers, or anyone on a do-not-call list.

**Interviewer**: So, for marketers, that’s less wasted spend, right? No more sending stuff to the wrong address or bugging people who don’t want to hear from you.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. You get this persistent, reliable view of each customer, so your targeting is way sharper—and your messaging is a lot less cringe.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s switch things up for a second. I want to dig into real-time recognition and personalization. How does Identity Essentials actually figure out who's visiting a site—especially if they haven't logged in yet? And how does it use that info to personalize things, like, right away?

**Interviewee**: Ah, that’s when the real fun begins! So—what we do is something called anonymous site recognition. Even if someone isn’t logged in, we’re able to recognize them in real time, using a mix of signals. Think device IDs, cookies, and some of our own secret sauce.

**Interviewer**: Wait—so even if it's their first time ever on the site?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Even first-timers. We combine those signals, and then—we actually add over 800 different attributes. Demographics, interests, lifestyle data…

**Interviewer**: 800? That’s wild. So you can tailor what people see, even if you don’t know exactly who they are?

**Interviewee**: Yep! We can personalize content, offers, even messaging. Now, can we do all that instantly, on the very first page a visitor sees? Sometimes, yeah. But more often, the really detailed personalization kicks in on the next page they visit.

**Interviewer**: Because you need a second to process everything, right?

**Interviewee**: Right, there’s just a bit of lag as the API and the website sync up. But it’s quick—fast enough that it feels seamless to the user.

**Interviewer**: So, basically, even people you don’t know, you get to know them pretty fast.

**Interviewee**: That's the idea! And because of that, brands see 3 to 5 times more chances to personalize, which really moves the needle on conversions and engagement.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s talk about activating audiences. How does Identity Essentials actually help brands reach customers—on both paid and owned channels? What does that do for campaign results?

**Interviewee**: Love this one. The secret sauce is in how we connect all the dots. For paid channels—like Facebook or Google—we unify your first-party data and match it to privacy-safe IDs. That way, you’re targeting real people, not just random devices.

**Interviewer**: So, you waste less money on ads that don’t reach the right folks?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Your match rates go way up, so your ads hit the mark instead of vanishing into the ether.

**Interviewer**: And what about owned channels? Like, your own email list?

**Interviewee**: Great point. On your owned channels, we keep those unified profiles alive. That means when someone switches from, say, your app to your website, personalization doesn’t just drop off a cliff.

**Interviewer**: So you’re not sending the same message twice, or losing people between platforms.

**Interviewee**: Right! It keeps everything consistent, which boosts engagement and conversion rates across the board. Brands usually see a big jump in ROI. It’s like finally getting your whole marketing band in tune, playing the same song for each customer.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's talk integration—how does Identity Essentials actually fit in with those big names, like Salesforce and Adobe? I mean, what does that look like on a daily basis for a brand?

**Interviewee**: Good question! So, Identity Essentials is really designed to, well, slot right into platforms like Salesforce and Adobe. With Salesforce, for instance, our identity and data stuff plugs straight into their CDP. Sapient usually handles the heavy lifting on the integration side.

**Interviewer**: So brands don't have to do all the set-up themselves?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! They can build super-precise segments right inside Salesforce, then push those audiences out across all their channels. And you can actually find Identity Essentials right on the Salesforce App Exchange—makes it easy to get started.

**Interviewer**: That sounds... surprisingly painless. What about Adobe?

**Interviewee**: Pretty similar, honestly! Our DX team gets Identity Essentials running inside Adobe’s AEP, so brands end up with much cleaner, more usable audience data. It’s all about making their marketing smarter, not harder.

**Interviewer**: So you’re not forcing brands to rip out their old systems and start over?

**Interviewee**: No, no, that’s the beauty of it. We're enhancing what they already have—not replacing it. Of course, there are challenges, especially with older data or making sure privacy rules are followed—but the benefits in personalization and efficiency? Totally worth it.

**Interviewer**: And you mentioned you actually sell alongside Salesforce and Adobe, right?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it’s a real partnership, not just a plug-in. We work together to make sure it all fits seamlessly.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s shift gears—privacy and data hygiene. With all this customer data moving around, how does Identity Essentials keep things clean, secure, and—most importantly—privacy-compliant? Especially when it comes to those opt-outs and deletion requests.

**Interviewee**: Privacy is huge. People expect more control over their info these days, and regulators are really stepping it up. With Identity Essentials, privacy isn’t an afterthought—it’s built in from the start.

**Interviewer**: So, if I wanted my data deleted, what would actually happen?

**Interviewee**: Great example. If someone requests a deletion or opt-out, the brand collects that request on their site. Then, Epsilon matches and removes that person’s info from the client’s systems. Usually, that’s done within a week—which is pretty fast when you’re talking enterprise-level data.

**Interviewer**: And what about ongoing data hygiene? Is that a one-and-done, or—

**Interviewee**: No, it’s ongoing. We’re constantly updating addresses, scrubbing duplicates, and flagging profiles that shouldn’t be contacted. It’s about minimizing waste, avoiding those cringe-worthy targeting mistakes, and—above all—honoring people’s preferences.

**Interviewer**: So brands aren’t just ticking boxes for compliance—they’re actually building trust.

**Interviewee**: That’s the goal! If you keep data clean and respect privacy, you’re not just reducing risk—you’re actually strengthening relationships with your customers.

**Interviewer**: So, you’ve talked about some really big wins—higher match rates, better personalization, way less wasted spend... Can you give me a real-world example? You know, a case study where Identity Essentials really changed the game for a brand?

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure. Let me set the scene. We had this retail client—classic case. Their customer data was a mess: duplicate profiles everywhere, money flying out the window on wasted ads, and these 'ghost' customers they couldn't even identify.

**Interviewer**: Ghost customers? That sounds... spooky. So what happened after they brought in Identity Essentials?

**Interviewee**: Well, first thing, we saw a 25% drop in duplicate profiles pretty much right away. So no more sending the same promo to the same person five times over.

**Interviewer**: That’s a relief. I’ve gotten those emails myself—so annoying.

**Interviewee**: Exactly, right? And their digital campaign match rates didn’t just improve—they shot up 5x. Suddenly their ads were finding real customers instead of just random lookalike devices.

**Interviewer**: That’s a huge jump. But was it just about better targeting?

**Interviewee**: No, it gets better. Their digital reach nearly tripled—so they were reaching way more actual people, but without spending more. And personalization on their site? Recognition rates went up three to five times, so visitors saw way more relevant content and offers, right as they landed.

**Interviewer**: So not just more people, but actually... the right people, seeing the right stuff. Did that translate into better results?

**Interviewee**: Big time. Happier customers, bigger conversion jumps, campaigns that actually delivered ROI—and their database? So much cleaner. It’s like, suddenly the lights turned on in a room that was full of clutter.

**Interviewer**: That’s a pretty compelling before-and-after. But, you know, there’s a lot of noise out there about identity solutions. Some folks are really skeptical. What myths do you hear the most?

**Interviewee**: Oh, where do I start? Some people think identity solutions are just fancy data cleaning. Or that they’re only for giant, data-obsessed companies. But honestly, if you want to market in a privacy-first, omnichannel world, getting identity right is non-negotiable.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not just for the big players. What else do brands get wrong?

**Interviewee**: A lot of folks think it’s all about cookies and third-party data, which is just not true. Identity Essentials is all about first-party data—the stuff you actually own, not what’s disappearing.

**Interviewer**: And what about implementation? Some people worry it’s going to take forever or totally wreck their existing setup.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, I hear that a lot. But with Identity Essentials, you’re plugging into your current stack, not tearing it apart. And privacy? That’s foundational, not tacked on at the end. Consent and transparency are built in from the start.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s not just hype. If you do identity right, it’s really the thing that makes all your other marketing tools work.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It’s the secret sauce. Without it, you’re just guessing—and wasting a lot of time and money.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so—if you had to, you know, sum it all up, what would you say are the top, maybe two or three things you want brands to remember about Identity Essentials? After everything we've talked about?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that's a strong wrap-up! Let me think... First off, Identity Essentials is really about seeing, well, actual people. Not just devices or random data points. You know what I mean?

**Interviewer**: So, less treating people like...numbers?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Less waste, better personalization, and—honestly—a much more human experience. That’s huge. Second, it’s not just a data clean-up thing.

**Interviewer**: No? What is it then?

**Interviewee**: It’s this whole engine for reaching more customers everywhere—across every channel. You get richer profiles, deeper insights...the works.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so, not just organizing, but actually powering your marketing?

**Interviewee**: Right, it’s driving the whole thing. And third? Privacy and trust—those aren’t optional anymore. They’re baked into every step. It’s about building real loyalty, not just ticking a compliance box.

**Interviewer**: So if folks remember one thing?

**Interviewee**: Remember this: Identity Essentials turns chaos into clarity. That’s the real game-changer for modern marketing.

**Interviewer**: Love that. Chaos into clarity. Okay, let’s look ahead—where do you see, I don’t know, the future of connected identity going? Especially with tech and privacy always changing. What should brands be doing now?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? We’re just getting started. I think identity solutions are going to be even more real-time, more holistic, and way more centered on the customer.

**Interviewer**: So like—profiles updating as people interact with you?

**Interviewee**: Exactly, yes! Not just session-based, but continuous. Context-aware. Imagine personalization that’s always on, always learning.

**Interviewer**: But privacy’s only getting tougher, right?

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure. Brands will have to double down on consent, transparency...and really minimize the data they collect.

**Interviewer**: So what should they do—like, right now?

**Interviewee**: Own your first-party data. Invest in future-proofed ID tech—like CORE ID. And be ready to adapt fast, because things change overnight.

**Interviewer**: So the winners will be those who...?

**Interviewee**: Balance personalization with privacy, and actually put the customer first. That’s it. That’s the whole ballgame.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let’s say a brand is listening right now and they're really fired up to get started—what does the actual onboarding with Identity Essentials look like? Is there, uh, anything they can do to make that rollout super smooth, maybe even a bit faster?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, totally. Getting started is actually pretty straightforward. But, you know, doing a little prep ahead of time? That really helps.

**Interviewer**: Prep as in...?

**Interviewee**: Once you sign the contract, you'll want to send over a few things—like your paperwork. That’s the fully signed MSA, your Statement of Work, and a W-9. Just make sure it’s from 2018 or later.

**Interviewer**: W-9 from 2018 or later, got it. Where do they send all this?

**Interviewee**: Just shoot it over to our onboarding team—CDPIE_Support@epsilon.com. After that, we set up some cross-team calls to figure out exactly what you need and map out the timeline.

**Interviewer**: So, what’s the one thing brands always forget, or maybe underestimate?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? Getting their customer data in order, especially their PII files. That’s the engine that powers Resolution & Hygiene.

**Interviewer**: Resolution & Hygiene, right. So, if their data’s ready...

**Interviewee**: ...the rollout is so much easier. Usually it takes about four to six weeks, but if you already know your data sources and your teams are prepped, it goes a lot faster.

**Interviewer**: And if someone’s not on Salesforce or Adobe?

**Interviewee**: Oh, don’t worry! We can work with other stacks too, just let us know early on so we can bring in the right folks from our end.

**Interviewer**: So, heads up early if it’s a different system. Got it.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
