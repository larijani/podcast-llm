## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about IE MCM.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's dive right in—can you give us, you know, the quick version: what is IE MCM, and why should marketers care?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, so IE MCM stands for Integrated Epsilon Multichannel Measurement. It's really about bringing together every touchpoint—email, direct mail, display ads, search, even stuff offline—and actually connecting them to real conversions.

**Interviewer**: So not just the digital bits, right?

**Interviewee**: Right, not just digital. Marketers get to see what’s working, not just online, but everywhere—the whole journey. These days, people jump between devices, channels... you know how it is.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, it's like, one minute they're on their phone, next they're in a store.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And because of that, having the whole picture is, honestly, just crucial. You’re spending smarter, targeting better, and you can actually justify the budget you’re asking for.

**Interviewer**: So, it's sort of like, putting on night-vision goggles for marketing—you’re not just guessing anymore.

**Interviewee**: Yeah! It’s the opposite of flying blind.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let me dig in a bit... Why does multichannel measurement matter more now than, say, five years ago? What's actually changed?

**Interviewee**: Honestly, the customer journey now? It’s wild. People don’t just see one ad and buy. They might see a display ad, then open an email, then maybe Google your company, and then—

**Interviewer**: —And then walk into a store, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And if you’re only tracking one of those, you’re missing out. It’s like looking at just one tree and missing the whole forest.

**Interviewer**: And with all the privacy stuff, cookies going away—

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that makes it even tougher to connect the dots. But with multichannel measurement, you’re able to actually see how everything works together. So you’re not wasting money, and you can optimize the whole journey.

**Interviewer**: So if you’re not doing this, you’re kind of just... leaving money on the table?

**Interviewee**: Pretty much. You’re missing out on a lot of value.

**Interviewer**: Alright, thanks for setting the scene! So, for everyone who's just tuning in... what can they expect from this episode? Any juicy insights or surprises you think will really stand out as we get into multichannel measurement?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, definitely. I mean, we’re not just going to talk theory here. Listeners are going to get the real nuts and bolts—like how multichannel measurement actually works day-to-day.

**Interviewer**: So, not just the textbook stuff?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! We’ll get into how to actually connect online and offline data—think website clicks, but also stuff like in-store visits—

**Interviewer**: Oh, so like tying together someone seeing a Facebook ad and then walking into a store?

**Interviewee**: Yes, exactly. And we’ll break down what attribution models really mean—there’s so much confusion there!—and how you can actually see all this laid out in a dashboard.

**Interviewer**: I love a good dashboard story.

**Interviewee**: Me too. And we’ve got some great war stories, like this mortgage provider who completely overhauled their whole marketing approach after seeing what was really working.

**Interviewer**: Wait, that sounds wild. You mean, they changed everything?

**Interviewee**: Oh yeah, and I think people will be surprised at just how detailed you can get. Not just which channel worked, but how every single touchpoint actually nudged someone toward a sale.

**Interviewer**: So, you’re saying it’s not just about picking a winning channel, but understanding the whole journey?

**Interviewee**: That’s it! And we’ll even dig into the common mistakes and myths—

**Interviewer**: Finally! Someone needs to clear those up.

**Interviewee**: We’re going to tackle them head-on.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s rewind a bit. Give it to me straight: how do you define multichannel measurement and attribution, in plain English? And, what’s the difference between just tracking channels and actually doing attribution?

**Interviewee**: Great question. So, multichannel measurement is just tracking every way you connect with your customer—emails, ads, mailers, in-store visits, all of it.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so just keeping tabs on the touchpoints.

**Interviewee**: Right. But attribution takes it to the next level. It’s not just about seeing what happened; it’s about figuring out which of those touchpoints deserve credit for a sale.

**Interviewer**: So, tracking is saying, “here’s what happened,” but attribution is more, “here’s what mattered”?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Without attribution, you’re basically just collecting receipts—you’re not really learning what actually moved the needle.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so, let’s dive into the customer journey for a second. Can you kind of walk us through what a real journey looks like when someone’s bouncing between online and offline touchpoints? Maybe give an example—like, how do all those different moments actually connect before someone finally converts?

**Interviewee**: Oh yeah, this is where it gets really good. Imagine someone shopping for a mortgage—first, they spot a display ad on their phone.

**Interviewer**: Oh, so they’re just scrolling, and—bam—there’s the ad?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And then, maybe a week later, they get a flyer in the mail. They tuck it away, but it sticks in their mind. After that, they’re curious—so they hop onto their laptop, start Googling rates.

**Interviewer**: And they probably see a paid search ad too, right?

**Interviewee**: Yes! They click that, read some more, and then—here’s the kicker—they walk into a branch to actually apply.

**Interviewer**: So every one of those steps leaves a sort of breadcrumb, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Each touchpoint, whether it’s digital or physical, is a little breadcrumb. And with multichannel measurement, we can tie all those breadcrumbs together. That’s where identity resolution comes in—it’s how we know these touchpoints all belong to the same person, not five different people.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not just guessing or relying on that last click anymore.

**Interviewee**: Nope! It’s more like being a detective—putting the whole story together, not just the ending.

**Interviewer**: You mentioned identity resolution. Can you break down how that actually works? Like, what kind of data are you stitching together to make sure you’re connecting the right dots between online and offline actions?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, totally. Identity alignment is, honestly, the secret sauce here. Behind the scenes, we’re connecting emails, device IDs, cookies, loyalty numbers—

**Interviewer**: Even physical addresses?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Anything that can tie back to a real person. For example, Epsilon’s CORE ID pulls all those signals together into one persistent profile. So, if someone opens an email, clicks a display ad, and then uses their loyalty card in-store, we know—it’s the same person.

**Interviewer**: So it’s way more accurate than just relying on cookies or device IDs.

**Interviewee**: Way more. The key is constantly validating and updating those links, so you’re not just guessing. That way, marketers get a real, people-based view—

**Interviewer**: —instead of a bunch of random, fragmented data points.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It’s about seeing the whole picture, not just the highlights.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's get into the weeds for a second. How do you actually connect all those different marketing touchpoints—stuff like ad impressions, email opens, and even offline purchases—how do you tie them all to a single conversion?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, great question. So, first thing we do is pull in all your data—media tags from your website, files from your CRM, even offline sales records. Basically, everything you can throw at us.

**Interviewer**: Even the old-school stuff? Like handwritten sales forms?

**Interviewee**: Oh, definitely. If it exists, we want it. Every single interaction gets tied to a persistent ID—something like Epsilon’s CORE ID.

**Interviewer**: So you’re basically tagging every event to that one ID?

**Interviewee**: Exactly, yeah. Then, for each person, we put all those events in order—email opens, display ad views, direct mail, all of it. We build a timeline for each customer.

**Interviewer**: So when someone finally buys something—

**Interviewee**: —we can look back and see the whole chain of events that led up to that conversion. It’s like, you get to see who saw what, when, and even where. No more guessing about what worked.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not just the last click that gets credit.

**Interviewee**: Right, you get the real story, not just the last step.

**Interviewer**: Alright, but let’s be real. What are the biggest headaches during data onboarding and integration, especially when you’re dealing with both online and offline stuff?

**Interviewee**: Oh, where do I start? Onboarding is where all the skeletons come out, honestly.

**Interviewer**: Messy data, I’m guessing?

**Interviewee**: That’s the big one. Dirty or inconsistent records—like mismatched emails, missing info, weird formatting from different systems.

**Interviewer**: And offline data's even messier, right?

**Interviewee**: Totally. Handwritten forms, laggy POS uploads, typos everywhere. Plus, you’ve got data silos—some teams act like they’re guarding treasure.

**Interviewer**: So, just getting everything lined up to one ID takes a ton of work.

**Interviewee**: It’s a lot of cleaning, matching, and honestly, some good old-fashioned detective work. But if you skip it, the whole model falls apart.

**Interviewer**: So, let’s get into the weeds here—where does all your data actually come from for multichannel measurement? And how do you keep all those data feeds from... well, clashing with each other?

**Interviewee**: Oh, it’s a bit of a circus, honestly! We grab data from anywhere that leaves a marketing footprint: email blasts, direct mail drops, display ad clicks, search campaigns—you name it. Even old-school stuff, like in-store purchases or call center logs. If it leaves a trail, we want it.

**Interviewer**: Wait, so you’re pulling from both online and offline channels? That sounds like a nightmare to piece together.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly! That’s the tricky part. We pull in structured data feeds—CSVs, CRM dumps, tag data, sometimes even third-party lists. The real trick is getting everything to speak the same language.

**Interviewer**: How do you do that? I mean, getting email opens and in-store buys to line up?

**Interviewee**: We use a common ID—usually something like a CORE ID—and timestamp every single event. That way, you can stack everything side by side, apples to apples.

**Interviewer**: But I bet there’s a lot of wrestling with messy formats, right?

**Interviewee**: Oh, tons. Field names, date formats, missing info—it’s a puzzle. But once you wrangle it all into place, you get this beautiful, unified picture of the customer journey.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s switch gears. Attribution models. Can you break down the difference between rule-based and model-based attribution for us?

**Interviewee**: Sure! Rule-based is kinda like following a set recipe—first click, last click, linear, you decide the rules up front. It’s simple, transparent, but not always the most accurate.

**Interviewer**: So, model-based is more... flexible?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it’s more like letting the data tell you the story. You use algorithms to figure out which touchpoints actually mattered. It’s deeper, but harder to explain to your boss sometimes.

**Interviewer**: So when would you use one over the other?

**Interviewee**: If you want something quick and easy to understand—or if your data is limited—go with rule-based. But if you’re ready to dig deeper and you’ve got the data muscle, model-based gets you closer to the truth.

**Interviewer**: Do you think brands should always jump right to model-based?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? No. I usually say start with rule-based—get your bearings, see how things connect. Then, once you’re comfortable, move up to model-based for the real detective work.

**Interviewer**: So, can you walk us through the most common rule-based attribution models? You know, things like first click, last click, and weighted. Maybe toss in a real-world example—how would each one paint a different picture for the exact same campaign?

**Interviewee**: Totally, yeah. So, first click—basically, it gives all the credit to whatever started things off. Say someone sees a display ad and that’s what gets them interested.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so all the glory goes to the first impression?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Meanwhile, last click is the opposite. It gives all the credit to the final touchpoint—maybe a paid search ad, right before the person makes the purchase.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s like the closer gets all the applause, even if the rest of the team set it up.

**Interviewee**: Right! And then there’s weighted models—think linear, where every touchpoint gets a slice of the credit, or position-based, where maybe the first and last get more, but the middle touches aren’t left out.

**Interviewer**: So, tell me, how would all that play out in, let’s say, a mortgage campaign?

**Interviewee**: Alright, picture this: first click says, 'That display ad started it all.' Last click? 'Search closed the deal.' Weighted? That’s where email and maybe a couple retargeting ads get their share of the credit because they nudged the customer along the way.

**Interviewer**: So depending on which model you use, you could end up optimizing for very different things—

**Interviewee**: Exactly, you might double down on awareness channels, or just focus on the closer, or try to improve the whole journey.

**Interviewer**: Alright, you’ve made the differences pretty clear. Now, what makes Epsilon’s attribution approach stand out? Can you break down some of the proprietary tech or features that set you apart?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, so Epsilon’s got a few tricks up its sleeve. The biggest one? CORE ID. It’s this persistent, people-based ID that links together all kinds of data—online, offline, you name it—at the individual level.

**Interviewer**: So, not just cookies or device IDs?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. We’re talking emails, direct mail, even in-store purchases—all tied back to one person. And then there’s our PeopleCloud platform, which basically scores and stores this data so we can run both the old-school rule-based models and the really advanced, model-based ones.

**Interviewer**: So you’re actually seeing the impact of every touch, even offline stuff that most tools miss?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, and that’s what really sets us apart. Most attribution tools just can’t do that level of identity resolution or cover as many channels. That’s Epsilon’s edge.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's dive into channel coverage for a minute—what channels can you, uh, actually measure with IE MCM? And are there any gotchas, like, when it comes to digital, offline, or maybe connected TV?

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure. IE MCM actually casts a really wide net. We're talking digital stuff—display, video, paid search, email, your website, all that.

**Interviewer**: So, all the usual suspects on the digital side.

**Interviewee**: Yep! And it doesn't stop there. We've got offline channels too, like direct mail, in-store purchases. And—this is cool—even connected TV, or CTV.

**Interviewer**: Wait, CTV too? That’s impressive. But is it tracked by household, or...?

**Interviewee**: Ah, good catch. Right now, it’s measured at the individual level—so if two people in a house watch, it tracks them separately. Household tracking, though, is definitely on our roadmap.

**Interviewer**: Interesting. And are there, like, hoops you have to jump through for certain channels?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, some channels need their own tagging, or you might have to feed in files, especially with offline stuff. Offline data can be a bit of a beast to wrangle.

**Interviewer**: But overall, you’d say the coverage is solid?

**Interviewee**: Absolutely. The magic really happens when you tie everything back to a persistent ID. That’s what gives you that unified view—no matter where someone interacted.

**Interviewer**: Love it. You brought up field-level data and identity resolution before—can you unpack what kinds of fields you’re capturing, and just how granular this data actually gets when you’re connecting events to people?

**Interviewee**: Totally. Field-level data means we’re tracking all the details—timestamps, device types, campaign IDs, creative versions, geo info... and the big one: identifiers like email or loyalty IDs.

**Interviewer**: So, if I, say, open an email or visit a store—

**Interviewee**: —Yep, every event like that is logged with all those pieces. Who, what, when, where, how—all of it.

**Interviewer**: Wow. So you can get super specific, right? Like, slice by channel, time of day—whatever you want.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. The data’s granular down to each individual event, per person. That’s how you get real people-based attribution.

**Interviewer**: So, how often do your clients get access to those detailed reports? Is it set in stone, or can they tweak how often they get updates—or even how much detail they see?

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally flexible! Most folks get their fresh data in Tableau once a month—

**Interviewer**: But if someone wants it more often—like weekly?

**Interviewee**: They can absolutely do that. Some even go daily, depending on what they need. It really comes down to their setup and what makes sense for their team.

**Interviewer**: And they can change what the reports show, right? Like filter by channel or campaign?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly! There are custom filters, so you can slice the data however you want—by channel, by campaign, by segment. No generic reports here.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not just a one-size-fits-all approach.

**Interviewee**: Right. The whole point is to make the data actually useful for whoever’s looking at it.

**Interviewer**: Nice. Okay, switching gears—when you kick off a new project, what actually happens in those first discovery sessions and data audits? Can you walk us through it?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, those are super important. First, we get everyone in a room and start asking questions—like, what are your real goals? Which channels are you running? Who’s your audience?

**Interviewer**: So you’re digging into strategy right from the start.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And we’ll look at any past attribution work—what’s gone well, what’s… not so much.

**Interviewer**: Then comes the data audit, right?

**Interviewee**: Yep. That’s where we roll up our sleeves and check all the data sources. We’re looking for missing fields, tracking issues, stuff that’ll trip us up later.

**Interviewer**: Like missing campaign tags, or IDs that don’t match up?

**Interviewee**: That’s it. If we don’t catch that stuff now, the whole attribution model can fall apart. So it’s kind of a mix—

**Interviewer**: Therapy session and detective work all in one?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! That’s what sets up everything else.

**Interviewer**: So, once you’ve finished the data audit—what happens next? How do you actually start building out the attribution models and code? I’m curious, what does that whole process look like behind the scenes?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, so once the audit’s wrapped, that’s when the real work kicks in. We roll up our sleeves and start building. First step? Picking the right attribution approach. Sometimes it’s last click, sometimes linear, or maybe even something totally custom, depending on what the business actually needs.

**Interviewer**: So you don’t just pick one model and run with it for everyone?

**Interviewee**: No, not at all. It’s really tailored. After that, we start writing code—Python or SQL, usually. The code does the heavy lifting: matching IDs, timestamping every event, and figuring out who gets credit for what conversion.

**Interviewer**: So it’s kind of like feeding the data through a machine that sorts it all out?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! The cleaned data goes in, and what you get out is a breakdown—channel by channel, conversion by conversion. And if it’s model-based attribution, sometimes we’ll even train a machine learning model to pick up on patterns that you’d miss just eyeballing the data.

**Interviewer**: Oh, so there’s a bit of data science magic in there as well.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, a little bit of magic—and a lot of testing. We QA everything, test with sample records, and tweak things until the numbers actually make sense.

**Interviewer**: And that’s before the dashboards come into play, right?

**Interviewee**: Right. Only once it all checks out do we plug it into Tableau for the dashboards. Honestly, it’s part engineering, part art, and more late-night debugging than I’d like to admit.

**Interviewer**: Okay, let’s get into those dashboards. What makes the Tableau dashboards you build actually useful for clients? Any features you love—or stories of how clients have used them to make real decisions?

**Interviewee**: Tableau really changes the game. It takes all that heavy data and makes it simple. Clients can instantly compare rule-based versus model-based attribution, or filter by customer segments—like prospects versus existing customers.

**Interviewer**: So they can really slice and dice the data however they want?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! They can drill down into channels, spot underperforming campaigns in minutes, and even shift budget right there—no more waiting for some monthly report to show up.

**Interviewer**: That must feel empowering for them.

**Interviewee**: It is. The interactivity is key. You’re not just reading a bunch of numbers—you’re exploring the story behind them. And everything’s in one place. No spreadsheet hell.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let's get into that mortgage provider case study. Can you—just walk us through the kind of customer journey they had?

**Interviewee**: Sure, yeah. Their journey was honestly...all over the place. People would see a display ad, then—maybe a week later—get a direct mail flyer, and then...

**Interviewer**: Pop onto the website?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Some clicked on paid search ads, some got emails. The whole gamut. But here’s the thing—what made it click was using multichannel measurement. That’s when we realized, wait, nearly every conversion touched at least three different channels.

**Interviewer**: Three? That many?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, and get this—the real surprise was how direct mail plus digital worked together. Like, someone would get a postcard, then later hit a Google search? And boom—that combo was huge for conversions.

**Interviewer**: So if you’d only looked at digital, you’d miss that, right?

**Interviewee**: Completely. Without connecting the dots, they would’ve missed that synergy. Attribution showed us it wasn’t just the last click that mattered. Sometimes, it was that direct mail piece—right before a search—that actually closed the deal.

**Interviewer**: So, it kind of flipped the whole campaign strategy on its head?

**Interviewee**: Totally. The way they planned budgets and sequenced campaigns changed overnight.

**Interviewer**: What about surprises? Any big learnings that caught your team off guard?

**Interviewee**: Oh, yeah—plenty. We went in thinking digital would be the star of the show. But honestly? That mix of direct mail and digital outperformed any single channel.

**Interviewer**: So, even old-school mail had a comeback moment?

**Interviewee**: Absolutely. And there’s more—the idea that 'last touch wins' got turned upside down. We saw early display ads or mailers setting up conversions days later.

**Interviewer**: So those early touchpoints were kind of the unsung heroes?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Offline stuff played a much bigger—and quieter—role than we thought. It made us totally rethink how we weighed and sequenced each channel.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's clear the air here—there are so many myths about multichannel measurement and attribution floating around. What’s the wildest or most common one you hear?

**Interviewee**: Oh, where do I even start? The one that always gets me is when people think attribution is just picking last click or first click. You know, like—

**Interviewer**: As if it’s that simple, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Real attribution digs much deeper. It’s about mapping the whole customer journey, figuring out who actually deserves credit at each step. Not just that last moment before a sale.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, and I’ve heard offline stuff is impossible to measure. That’s a big one too.

**Interviewee**: Totally false. If you’ve got the right data and identity markers, offline is absolutely measurable. People are surprised by that every time.

**Interviewer**: And what about the idea that attribution is just plug-and-play? Like you turn it on and—

**Interviewee**: —Instant answers! No way. It’s a lot of messy data wrangling and ongoing tweaking. I always tell clients, it’s not magic. But if you stick with it, the clarity you get is worth all the hassle.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so after busting all those myths, if you had to give marketers just a couple key takeaways to get started with multichannel measurement—what should they focus on first?

**Interviewee**: First thing: don’t ignore the groundwork. Clean your data, map it out, and tie it to a real identity—like CORE ID or something equivalent.

**Interviewer**: So, start with the basics, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And then, before you jump into all the fancy, complex models, start simple. Use rule-based attribution—trust me, you’ll learn so much just from that.

**Interviewer**: And I bet there’s something about offline touchpoints in there too?

**Interviewee**: You read my mind. Offline matters more than most people realize. Don’t leave it out. If you focus there, you’ll already be ahead of a lot of marketers.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so let's talk about the future. Where do you see multichannel measurement heading in the next few years? Any big tech shifts or trends on your radar?

**Interviewee**: Oh, things are about to get... pretty intense, honestly. We're going to see privacy rules tighten up even more—

**Interviewer**: Wait, even more than now? That seems... tough!

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it’ll push everyone to double down on first-party data. Persistent IDs, like CORE ID, are gonna be huge. And then there’s AI—

**Interviewer**: Of course, AI! What’s it going to change?

**Interviewee**: A lot. AI will start automating all that messy data wrangling, attribution modeling... the stuff that eats up hours.

**Interviewer**: So, less grunt work for people?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And get ready for even more channels joining the party. Think smart TVs, voice assistants, even IoT gadgets.

**Interviewer**: Wow, so measuring across your fridge and your TV?

**Interviewee**: Pretty much! Eventually, real-time, people-based measurement will just be the expectation, not a fancy extra.

**Interviewer**: And the marketers who crack identity and data integration...

**Interviewee**: ...they’ll pull way ahead. No question.

**Interviewer**: Alright, before we finish up—any advice for marketers who are feeling totally lost in all this data chaos?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, don’t get stuck waiting for things to be perfect. Seriously, everyone’s data is kind of messy.

**Interviewer**: So just start somewhere?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Clean up what you can, choose a couple channels to focus on. Celebrate those small wins, you know?

**Interviewer**: Because those add up—

**Interviewee**: Right! Clarity compounds. Every step makes it easier. You’ll get there.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
