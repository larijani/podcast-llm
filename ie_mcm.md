## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about IE MCM.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's dive in. For folks who might be new here, can you break down what IE MCM actually is? And, you know, why should marketers really care about this whole multichannel measurement thing?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, definitely. So, IE MCM stands for Integrated Epsilon Multichannel Measurement. Basically, it's a system to track and attribute marketing touchpoints across every channel—so online stuff, offline stuff, the whole mix.

**Interviewer**: Every channel? You mean, like, someone sees an ad on their phone, then maybe gets an email—

**Interviewee**: —or they visit your website, maybe even walk into a physical store before buying. Exactly! People bounce around a lot before making a decision.

**Interviewer**: Right, so if you're only looking at one channel, you’re missing... what, most of what’s really happening?

**Interviewee**: Pretty much! If you're tracking just, say, email, you're not seeing the whole journey. IE MCM basically connects all those dots for you so you can actually see how your marketing is working together.

**Interviewer**: And that's... that's a big deal now because consumers are everywhere at once, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! In today’s world, that holistic view? It’s a total game changer for marketers. Every dollar you spend can work harder when you actually know where it’s going and what it’s doing.

**Interviewer**: So, you hinted at this, but what actually happens if marketers don’t track across all these channels? Like, what goes wrong?

**Interviewee**: Oh, where do I start—this is where it gets rough. If you don’t have real multichannel measurement, you end up making decisions with... well, honestly, bad data.

**Interviewer**: Bad data like thinking a channel isn’t working, but really it’s just not being tracked?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Say your paid search looks like it’s underperforming, but maybe it actually drove someone into your store. If you miss that, you might cut funding, not realizing it was actually doing a lot behind the scenes.

**Interviewer**: So you could be pouring money into email because it looks like it’s winning—

**Interviewee**: —when it’s just the last nudge before a sale that really started with a different channel. You end up missing hidden ROI, and sometimes even cutting stuff that’s actually helping you win.

**Interviewer**: That sounds... risky. Like, you’re running a race but you have no idea where the baton is.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! It’s like trying to win a relay race blindfolded. You’re running hard, but you just can’t see where the handoff really happens.

**Interviewer**: So, what makes IE MCM different from, you know, the usual attribution tools or measurement solutions out there? Like, what’s actually new here—what sets it apart in today’s marketing world?

**Interviewee**: Oh, yeah, that’s a great place to start. The big thing with IE MCM is how it brings together both online and offline data, which—honestly—most other tools just can’t manage.

**Interviewer**: Wait, both? So, like, digital ads AND in-store stuff?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! We’re talking everything from digital ads, emails, even in-store visits. IE MCM ties all those touchpoints together using Epsilon’s proprietary CORE ID tech.

**Interviewer**: Ah, so not just cookies or last-click tracking, then?

**Interviewee**: Right, none of that old-school, cookie-only stuff. With CORE ID, you get this persistent, people-based identity. And then PeopleCloud comes in—it powers model scoring and activation at scale, with super high match rates.

**Interviewer**: Model scoring... so that means it can, what, actually predict and activate campaigns for real people?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly! Plus, you’re not stuck with a one-size-fits-all approach. You get access to custom attribution models—rule-based, data-driven, whatever fits YOUR customer journey.

**Interviewer**: So it actually adapts to how customers move, not just what some algorithm thinks they’ll do?

**Interviewee**: That’s the leap. So, instead of using siloed or cookie-based tools, you get a real, unified view of your customers. It’s a massive shift.

**Interviewer**: Let’s get into the weeds for a second: How does IE MCM actually link a person’s identity across all those different channels and devices, especially with all the privacy stuff and data fragmentation going on now?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, this is really where IE MCM stands out. CORE ID is like the backbone—it’s a persistent, people-based identity that stitches together all these signals: emails, cookies, device IDs, loyalty cards, even hashed PII like names and addresses.

**Interviewer**: So even if someone switches devices or shops online and in person, you’re... still able to keep track of who’s who?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. They’re constantly updating and reconciling those signals as people move across channels. But—and this is important—it’s all done ethically.

**Interviewer**: Right, because privacy is huge now. How do they keep it safe?

**Interviewee**: Everything’s hashed, anonymized, and totally compliant with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. Instead of depending on fragile cookies or device graphs, CORE ID gives you a strong, durable identity graph.

**Interviewer**: So, you get accurate measurement, but customers’ info is still protected?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. You get that unified customer view, but never at the expense of privacy. That’s the magic—accurate results without creeping anyone out.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's dive into something that's always stumped marketers—connecting online and offline events. Can you walk us through how IE MCM actually links, say, someone seeing a digital ad to them making a purchase in-store? What's really going on behind the scenes to make that happen?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, totally. So this is where IE MCM kinda shows off, honestly. Picture this: you’re scrolling on your phone, you see a display ad—maybe you even click on it, poke around the website—and then, a few days later, you wander into an actual store and make a purchase.

**Interviewer**: Right, and most systems would just... lose track of you at that point, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! That's the usual problem. But with IE MCM, every single touchpoint gets logged—so, the ad view, the website visit, even opening an email—all of it is tied to something called a persistent CORE ID.

**Interviewer**: CORE ID—so, what is that, like an email address or...?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, sometimes it’s your email, sometimes a loyalty card number, or even just a device ID. The magic is, when you go in-store and use your loyalty card or give your email for a digital receipt, that purchase gets matched back to your CORE ID.

**Interviewer**: So you get a full timeline: ad view, site visit, and then—bam—store purchase?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! IE MCM connects all those dots, even if the channels don’t naturally talk to each other. It does the heavy lifting of stitching everything together. So marketers finally see the real story, not just the last click before you buy.

**Interviewer**: That’s wild. Okay, switching gears—channel coverage. What channels can IE MCM actually measure these days? And, I mean, are there any unexpected ones that might surprise marketers?

**Interviewee**: So, it’s pretty broad, honestly. IE MCM is like the Swiss Army knife of measurement. Out of the box, you’ve got display, video, paid search—the usual stuff. Website activity too, whether you’re on desktop or mobile.

**Interviewer**: And it’s not just your own site, right? What about external media?

**Interviewee**: Right, it gets interesting here. IE MCM can track media served by Epsilon, even across different devices, plus external media through big DSPs like Yahoo and The Trade Desk. Paid search too, but just clicks for now. And all the website interactions get picked up with a first-party tag.

**Interviewer**: Okay, but what about offline stuff? Can it handle, like, in-store purchases or call center calls?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that’s where it gets spicy! IE MCM can pull in offline events—so, in-store purchases, call center interactions—and tie those back to your digital touchpoints. TV measurement, too, at the individual level. And household-level is coming soon.

**Interviewer**: Wait, so you can actually measure TV at the individual level? That’s rare!

**Interviewee**: Super rare! Most tools can’t do TV at all. So if you’re running omnichannel campaigns, the real question isn’t 'Can we measure it?'—it’s 'What CAN'T we measure?' And honestly, that list is getting shorter by the day.

**Interviewer**: Alright, attribution models—let's dive in. So, IE MCM offers everything from first click to, you know, these data-driven approaches. Can you just walk us through what these different models actually mean, in practice? And, I guess, how should a marketer decide which one to use?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, totally! Attribution models are basically the rules that decide how much credit each touchpoint gets for a conversion.

**Interviewer**: So—like, which ad or interaction gets the win, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! First click is the simplest: 100% of the credit goes to the very first touchpoint. It’s great for seeing what sparks someone’s interest, but it ignores the rest of the journey.

**Interviewer**: And last click is kind of the opposite, right? Only the final step gets the glory.

**Interviewee**: Yes! That’s the classic one—last click. It gives all the credit to the last thing someone did before buying. That’s why, you know, emails and search ads often look like they’re winning.

**Interviewer**: But real journeys aren’t usually that simple, are they?

**Interviewee**: No, not at all! That’s where weighted models come in. Linear models, for example, spread the credit out evenly across every touchpoint. Position-based models might give more weight to the first and last touches, and less to everything in between.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s kind of like giving out slices of a pie—some bigger, some smaller, depending on where they fall in the journey.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And then you have data-driven models—which are, honestly, the gold standard. They use actual data to figure out which touchpoints matter most, taking into account all the twists and turns people take.

**Interviewer**: And IE MCM’s secret sauce is that it pulls in online and offline data, right?

**Interviewee**: Yep! So, it’s not just tracking what happens online, but also in-store or on the phone—wherever those interactions happen.

**Interviewer**: How does someone pick? I mean, with all these options, it sounds kind of overwhelming.

**Interviewee**: It can be! If your customer journeys are short and pretty straightforward, then a rule-based model—like first or last click—might work fine. But if your journeys are longer or more complicated, or you really want to know what’s driving impact, then data-driven is where you want to be.

**Interviewer**: And you’re not stuck with one forever, right?

**Interviewee**: Not at all! That’s the cool thing about IE MCM—you can actually test out different models and see which one fits your business best.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so shifting gears a bit. Identity alignment and cross-channel complexity—these sound like massive headaches. What are some of the toughest problems you run into when trying to match people across all these channels? And how does IE MCM handle it?

**Interviewee**: Oh, this is the tricky part! The biggest challenge is fragmentation. People use tons of devices, they clear cookies, they shop online and in stores—sometimes even share devices with family members.

**Interviewer**: So, traditional tools just... can’t keep up, can they?

**Interviewee**: Nope. Most traditional tools rely on cookies, which are honestly on their way out. IE MCM tackles this with something called CORE ID. It’s persistent and people-based, so it pieces together data from emails, device IDs, loyalty cards—all kinds of sources.

**Interviewer**: So if I switch from my phone to my laptop, CORE ID still knows it’s me?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Even if you change devices or channels, CORE ID keeps tracking your journey. And the system is always updating and reconciling the data, so you’re less likely to lose track of someone’s path.

**Interviewer**: But what about privacy? That’s a huge concern these days.

**Interviewee**: Totally. Everything is hashed, anonymized, and built to comply with privacy laws. It’s not perfect—no system is—but IE MCM gets you about as close to a unified view as you can in today’s messy, fragmented world.

**Interviewer**: Okay, let's dig into dashboards for a second. How does having all that attribution data right there, visualized in something like Tableau—how does that actually change the way marketers make decisions, you know, day-to-day?

**Interviewee**: Oh, it changes everything. I mean, before dashboards, you’re just... lost in spreadsheets, right?

**Interviewer**: Rows and rows of numbers—yeah, total headache.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! But once you get it all visualized, suddenly you can see which channels are really pulling their weight. And you can spot trends, drill down into specific campaigns, or even look at how different customer segments are behaving.

**Interviewer**: So you’re saying it’s not just about looking pretty? You get real, actionable insights?

**Interviewee**: Oh, definitely. I’ve seen brands who were totally convinced paid search was their MVP channel—

**Interviewer**: —let me guess, then the dashboard told a different story?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! The dashboard showed that, actually, social was doing all the heavy lifting with new customers. Or sometimes a channel everyone thought was ‘meh’ turned out to be a superstar for a key segment.

**Interviewer**: That must be a big shock—

**Interviewee**: —it is! And the best part? You can filter in real time, see what’s working for prospects versus existing customers, and those hidden wins just jump out at you.

**Interviewer**: So you’re not waiting around for a monthly report anymore.

**Interviewee**: Right! You can pivot your entire strategy as soon as the data comes in. It’s like turning on the lights.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s get into that mortgage provider case study. Can you walk us through what their cross-channel customer journey looked like?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that one was wild. So, imagine someone starts with a display ad, maybe clicks through a social campaign, ends up on the website—

**Interviewer**: —fills out a lead form, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly, but here’s where it gets interesting: the real magic happened offline. People would call a call center, visit a branch, or get follow-up emails and even direct mail.

**Interviewer**: So you’re saying it wasn’t just a digital journey?

**Interviewee**: Not at all. IE MCM stitched together every touchpoint, online and offline. The insights were fascinating: digital channels warmed up the leads, but the actual conversions? Those happened offline. Calls and in-branch visits were crucial.

**Interviewer**: And did the dashboards help reveal that?

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally. For example, paid social had a huge influence early on, but it almost never got credit for the final conversion. The dashboard made it obvious: if you only looked at last-touch, you’d miss the real value of those initial channels.

**Interviewer**: So, the takeaway is you can’t just throw all your money at the one channel that looks good on paper.

**Interviewee**: Right. The data made it crystal clear: you need to invest in both digital and offline touchpoints. Otherwise, you’re just missing half the picture.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so there’s a ton of debate about multichannel attribution. Some people say it’s just way too complicated—or even, you know, "impossible." Others think it’s just a buzzword for spending more money on marketing. What’s the biggest thing people get wrong about multichannel measurement?

**Interviewee**: Oh, where do I even start? The biggest one I hear is that multichannel attribution is, like, some sort of magic trick. Or, worse, total snake oil.

**Interviewer**: Snake oil, really?

**Interviewee**: Yeah! People go, “It’s too messy, so why even bother?” But honestly, sure, it’s complex, but it’s not impossible. The goal isn’t to be perfect—it’s about getting closer to the truth.

**Interviewer**: Just getting closer, not perfect? That’s kind of a relief.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, you can drive yourself crazy chasing the 'exact' answer. Another big myth is that this is all just a ploy for agencies to—

**Interviewer**: —to get a bigger budget, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! But real multichannel measurement is about spending smarter, not more. It actually helps you spot where you’re wasting money, so you can cut out what isn’t working.

**Interviewer**: So it’s about making your budget go further, not just inflating it.

**Interviewee**: That’s it. Ignoring cross-channel influence is way riskier than wrestling with the messiness. Even small steps in attribution can drive big gains.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so if you had to sum it all up—what should marketers really remember about IE MCM and, you know, modern attribution?

**Interviewee**: Alright, here’s my take: First, you can’t ignore the whole customer journey anymore. People are everywhere—online, offline, switching devices—and if you’re not connecting those dots, your data’s... well, it’s lying to you.

**Interviewer**: Your data’s lying? That’s a strong way to put it.

**Interviewee**: I mean it! IE MCM’s superpower is bringing all those touchpoints together, using privacy-safe IDs, so you can actually see what’s working.

**Interviewer**: And you’re not saying it has to be perfect.

**Interviewee**: Not at all. It’s about progress, not perfection. Make better decisions, move faster, find value you couldn’t see before.

**Interviewer**: So, multichannel attribution isn’t some luxury now—it’s just, what, part of the basics?

**Interviewee**: Table stakes. If you want to win in marketing today, you can’t afford to skip it.

**Interviewer**: So, looking ahead... what do you think is going to be the biggest change—or maybe innovation—in multichannel measurement in the next few years?

**Interviewee**: Oh, there’s a lot brewing! For one, I think we’re going to move from just individual measurement to household-level as the norm.

**Interviewer**: Wait, so you mean tracking everyone in the house, not just one person?

**Interviewee**: Yeah! Especially as TV and connected TV—CTV—get rolled in with everything else. That means we’ll start seeing insights about, you know, how people share devices or watch together.

**Interviewer**: Interesting. And what about privacy? That’s getting tighter, right?

**Interviewee**: Totally. Privacy rules are only getting stricter. So, companies will have to lean more into first-party data, ethical ways of resolving IDs, and these things called 'clean rooms' for secure data collaboration.

**Interviewer**: Clean rooms? That sounds... mysterious.

**Interviewee**: It’s less exciting than it sounds—basically a safe way for companies to compare data without exposing anyone’s personal info.

**Interviewer**: Got it. And AI—what’s happening there?

**Interviewee**: That’s the other big one. We’re heading towards real-time, AI-powered attribution. Imagine being able to optimize campaigns as the customer journey unfolds—on the fly.

**Interviewer**: So, instant feedback. That’s wild. Are we talking just digital, or does this pull in offline stuff too?

**Interviewee**: Oh, both! The line between online and offline is blurring even more. Things like call center data, in-store activity, even IoT devices—they’ll all get stitched together.

**Interviewer**: Wow, so marketers need to be ready for some big changes.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, and honestly, they should start investing now in ID graphs that can flex and adapt—future-proof stuff. And really get comfortable with privacy-first measurement.

**Interviewer**: So the old 'set it and forget it' days are over?

**Interviewee**: Completely. Agility is the new secret weapon.

**Interviewer**: Love it. Okay, last question before we wrap up—if someone’s just starting out with multichannel measurement, what’s the one mindset, or maybe a habit, that you think really matters for long-term success?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? Curiosity is way more important than perfection. Don’t get stuck trying to build the ultimate model on day one.

**Interviewer**: So—start with what you can measure?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Start where you are, ask tough questions, keep digging for what’s really going on behind the numbers.

**Interviewer**: And expect to change things as you go?

**Interviewee**: All the time. Treat your measurement stack like a living thing—it needs tuning as channels, privacy, and customer habits shift.

**Interviewer**: Stay humble, right?

**Interviewee**: Yes! Be open to surprises, because sometimes your best channel is hiding right in front of you.

**Interviewer**: So the winners are the ones who keep learning?

**Interviewee**: They never stop. That’s the real long-term edge.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
