## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about Short test.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let's kick this off—how would you, um, describe 'connected identity' when it comes to modern marketing?

**Interviewee**: Connected identity, yeah. It’s really about being able to recognize someone—your customer—no matter where they’re showing up. Like, whether they're browsing your website on their laptop, scrolling on their phone, or even walking into your store.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s not just about online, you mean everywhere?

**Interviewee**: Exactly, everywhere. The idea is to stitch all those touchpoints together. So you’re not treating someone like a stranger just because they switched from their laptop to their phone, or from online to in-person.

**Interviewer**: Right, because that can feel weird—like, 'Wait, don’t you know who I am?'

**Interviewee**: Totally! And the real magic is moving away from talking to devices or cookies, and actually seeing the human behind the screen, you know?

**Interviewer**: So it’s more personal. Less 'Hey, random user,' and more, well, 'Hey, Sarah, welcome back!'

**Interviewee**: Yes, and when you do that, you can keep up as people’s preferences and habits change. Which is happening all the time, by the way.

**Interviewer**: Speaking of change—why do you think it’s so crucial for brands to really understand how their customers’ profiles and behaviors keep evolving?

**Interviewee**: Great question. Customers, they’re not static at all. Their interests, their needs—they’re shifting constantly. Sometimes overnight!

**Interviewer**: Yeah, like someone who just had a baby, or changed jobs, or suddenly got obsessed with pickleball because of TikTok—

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And if brands don’t keep up with that, their messages start to feel super irrelevant, or even annoying.

**Interviewer**: But if you do keep up, if you’re tracking those changes—

**Interviewee**: Then you can actually deliver stuff that matters to people right now. Not who they were six months ago. That’s how you stay relevant. That’s how you keep people coming back.

**Interviewer**: So, let me ask you—what are some of the biggest gaps you notice in customer data these days? And, um, how do you see those gaps actually affecting the customer experience?

**Interviewee**: Oh, where do I start? Honestly, most brands only get this tiny slice of a customer’s life—maybe they see a purchase here, or someone signs up for an email there, but not the full story.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, it’s like they’re missing the context, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And the real problem is, all that data ends up locked away in different silos. So, your app data doesn’t talk to your in-store system, and your email list? Not synced with your ad platforms.

**Interviewer**: So you get duplicate profiles, or you end up sending the same ad to someone who’s already bought the thing.

**Interviewee**: Yes! Or, you miss them completely because you just can’t connect the dots. And now, with privacy rules changing and cookies going away, it’s even harder to see the whole picture.

**Interviewer**: So the customer gets this kind of... disconnected experience, and the brand wastes money on targeting that doesn’t work?

**Interviewee**: That’s it. It’s a bit like trying to have a conversation, but you’re only catching every third word. The customer feels misunderstood, and the brand never really builds loyalty.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s talk about Epsilon’s Identity Essentials. Can you walk us through how it actually solves this problem? How does it help brands connect all those dots?

**Interviewee**: Sure! So, think of Epsilon’s Identity Essentials as the ultimate glue for all your customer data. At the center is something we call CORE ID—it’s like a living, breathing profile for each customer.

**Interviewer**: A profile that keeps changing as the customer interacts?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It pulls together everything: online actions like browsing or clicking emails, and even offline things like in-store purchases. No more siloed data—just one persistent view of the real person, not just their device or a random cookie.

**Interviewer**: And it’s always learning, right? So if I look at jeans online and then buy boots in-store, it connects that?

**Interviewee**: That’s right. It stitches all those moments together into a single profile. Plus, it enriches your data with industry insights and is ready to activate in media channels.

**Interviewer**: So you can actually reach people with the right message, at the right time, wherever they are?

**Interviewee**: Yes, and that’s the real game-changer. It moves brands away from that old, fragmented approach. Now you can actually personalize at scale—and customers feel recognized, not just targeted.

**Interviewer**: Earlier, you mentioned real-time personalization and better reach. Can you walk us through how brands are actually using this stuff? Like, how are they making experiences more relevant—or, you know, boosting their results?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, sure! So, picture this: you’re a retailer, right? And one of your regulars is checking out winter coats online, but they don’t buy anything.

**Interviewer**: Oh, I know that move. I do it all the time.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly. So, with real-time identity in place, the brand can instantly send you a personalized email or even an app notification with a discount on those exact coats.

**Interviewer**: Wait, so it’s not just random deals? It’s actually what I was looking at?

**Interviewee**: Right, no weird guesswork. It’s just relevant. And it doesn’t stop there—maybe you’re browsing elsewhere and you suddenly see an ad for those coats, but it’s tailored to you. It’s not creepy, it’s just... useful.

**Interviewer**: So, it knows what I want, but in a good way.

**Interviewee**: That’s the idea. And take a big sports brand—like Nike, for example. They work with retail media networks to reach shoppers at places like Dick’s Sporting Goods.

**Interviewer**: So, like, connecting the dots between what I look at online and what I check out in-store?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. So, if you’ve shown interest in running shoes both online and at the store, Nike can serve you a special offer—just for you—using first-party data that’s all stitched together.

**Interviewer**: And what happens if I actually buy the shoes?

**Interviewee**: That’s the best part. Because the data updates in real time, once you buy them, the system stops bothering you with ads for those shoes. No more wasted impressions.

**Interviewer**: That’s such a relief. Nothing worse than seeing ads for something you already bought.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! So brands get better ROI, and customers get these timely, actually helpful interactions instead of a bunch of spam. Everybody wins.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so big picture—how would you sum up the real impact connected identity has on marketing effectiveness and, you know, the customer experience?

**Interviewee**: Honestly, it’s a total game-changer. Marketers aren’t just throwing ads into the void or spamming people with irrelevant stuff anymore.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, it sounds way more targeted.

**Interviewee**: Right. It’s about reaching the right people at the right moment, with something that actually matters to them.

**Interviewer**: And for the customer?

**Interviewee**: It doesn’t feel stalker-ish. It’s more like, hey, this brand gets me. The offers and experiences actually fit your life right now—not what some old profile thinks you want.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s smarter, it’s... kinder marketing?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly. It’s what people expect now. Brands that do this well? They build trust, loyalty, and, honestly, real results.

**Interviewer**: So, for brands that are just dipping their toes into data-driven personalization... where do they even start? What's the first thing they should focus on if they want to build a connected identity strategy?

**Interviewee**: Oh, good question. And honestly? My first bit of advice is—don’t overcomplicate things. But also, you know, don’t skip the basics.

**Interviewer**: Basics like...?

**Interviewee**: Well, first-party data. Get that sorted out before anything else. Make sure every customer interaction—online, in-store, wherever—all gets tied back to a single, unified profile.

**Interviewer**: So, it's like... putting all the puzzle pieces in one box?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. If your data’s scattered, you’re never going to see the full picture. Then, once you’ve got that, think about your tech. You need tools that connect those dots in real time—not just, you know, updating once a week or whenever.

**Interviewer**: So, not just batch updates. Real time, right?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, real time makes a huge difference. And start simple—maybe personalize emails or website content first. You don’t have to do everything at once.

**Interviewer**: So, small wins before you go big.

**Interviewee**: That’s it. And I can’t stress this enough—be open with your customers about what you’re doing with their data. That transparency? It’s what builds trust and sets you up for the long run.

**Interviewer**: Right, because people want to know how their info is being used.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Be upfront, and you’ll earn loyalty—and a lot fewer headaches down the road.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
