## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about Tagging.

**Interviewer**: Hey, thanks for joining us today!

**Interviewee**: Yeah, of course—thanks for having me.

**Interviewer**: So, before we jump in—could you just... tell us a little about your background? And, you know, what pulled you into this whole world of digital tagging?

**Interviewee**: Sure! Yeah, I guess, for me, it all started kind of by accident. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes the way we act—especially the way brands and people connect online.

**Interviewer**: Oh, you mean like... how ads follow you around the internet?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Early on, I was at this agency, and we were always trying to figure out what actually made people buy stuff. It was like, we had all these numbers, but nothing added up.

**Interviewer**: Right, it’s a mystery sometimes.

**Interviewee**: Yeah! Then tagging came along. Suddenly, it was like we had X-ray vision. We could see which touchpoints mattered, where people dropped off—what content got them excited.

**Interviewer**: So you got hooked on the data, right?

**Interviewee**: Completely. That real-time feedback? I mean, it just drew me in. Now, I’m obsessed with making tagging smarter, and, you know, more privacy-friendly, because it’s basically the backbone of digital experiences now.

**Interviewer**: You called tagging a 'magic lens.' For folks who are new to this stuff, could you break down what tagging really is? And why it’s such a big deal for brands?

**Interviewee**: Yeah! So, tagging’s actually pretty simple at its core. It’s just a snippet of code you drop on your website, your app, sometimes even in emails.

**Interviewer**: So it’s like... putting a tracker on a package?

**Interviewee**: That’s a perfect way to put it! You get to see where the package goes, how it’s handled, when it arrives—except here, you’re tracking what people do online. Which pages they visit, what products catch their eye, if they put stuff in their cart or just... vanish.

**Interviewer**: And all that info, that’s what helps brands—

**Interviewee**: —understand their audience. Personalize experiences. Measure what’s working and what’s not. Without tagging, it’s like flying blind.

**Interviewer**: But with privacy, that’s tricky, right?

**Interviewee**: Definitely! Smart tagging means you can deliver value, but still respect what users want in terms of privacy. It’s all about balance.

**Interviewer**: Alright, for folks tuning in—what are they actually gonna walk away with after listening to this episode? I mean, specifically about tagging.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, great question. So, by the end, listeners are really going to get that tagging is way more than just some tech add-on. It’s... it’s actually essential for creating great customer experiences—and for business results too.

**Interviewer**: So not just some nerdy thing in the background.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! We’re talking about how tagging powers everything. Real-time personalization, measurement—even across different devices, different channels, you name it.

**Interviewer**: Oh, so like, if I’m on my phone and my laptop...

**Interviewee**: ...right, it connects those dots. And we’ll get into the privacy side of things too—data ownership, compliance, and how tagging’s changing now that cookies are, well... disappearing.

**Interviewer**: That’s huge. So, basically, people will learn how tagging isn’t just about tracking, but about smarter marketing and—

**Interviewee**: —and about trust. About keeping customer trust front and center. It’s all about future-proofing your marketing.

**Interviewer**: Alright, you mentioned real-time insights. But can you give us, you know, an actual example? How does tagging improve the experience for me, or for a brand?

**Interviewee**: Definitely. So, picture this: you’re shopping for sneakers online. With good tags, the brand knows what you looked at, your size, maybe even if you got stuck at checkout.

**Interviewer**: So next time I visit—

**Interviewee**: —you get a homepage just for you. Maybe those same sneakers, now on sale, in your size. That’s tagging making it personal.

**Interviewer**: And for the brand?

**Interviewee**: They can actually see what brought you there. Which campaigns worked, which channels converted, where people drop off. That means they can make better ads, send smarter emails, and not waste money.

**Interviewer**: So for me, that’s less annoying pop-ups, more stuff I care about.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! It’s a win-win. Brands save money, you save time, and the whole experience just feels smoother.

**Interviewer**: Okay, you mentioned real-time data collection before—so I’m curious, how does tagging actually handle pulling in data from all these different places? I mean, you’ve got apps, websites, emails... sometimes all at once.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that’s a great point. The cool thing about modern tagging is, well, it doesn’t really care where the data comes from. It’s what we call channel-agnostic.

**Interviewer**: Meaning it just… grabs everything, everywhere?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! So, let’s take Epsilon for example—

**Interviewer**: Epsilon, that’s the platform you use, right?

**Interviewee**: Right. With their setup, you just install one tagging solution. That’s it. And it starts feeding in data from your website, your app, your emails, even your digital ads—

**Interviewer**: All at the same time?

**Interviewee**: Yep, all at once, and in real time. The tags themselves are a little different depending on where you put them—web, app, email—but the backend puts all that info together. So if someone clicks an email on their phone, then later visits your site from their laptop—

**Interviewer**: It knows it’s the same person?

**Interviewee**: That’s the magic. It recognizes them and connects the dots across every channel. So brands get this, like, full, 360-degree, live dashboard of what customers are doing—

**Interviewer**: Which means you can personalize on the fly, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And optimize your marketing right there, as things are happening.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so you’ve mentioned personalization a few times… can you break down how tagging actually makes that possible? Maybe give an example—how it leads to better measurement, higher conversion, you know?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, so, personalization is really where tagging shines. Let’s say you drop a tag on your site or app—suddenly, every little interaction gets logged: what someone clicks, how long they stick around, even where they give up.

**Interviewer**: So, you’re building this super-detailed profile for each person?

**Interviewee**: Exactly, and not just on one device. Across everything—phone, laptop, whatever. Say you’re a retailer, and there’s a customer who keeps looking at running shoes but never actually buys.

**Interviewer**: So the tag picks up on that pattern?

**Interviewee**: Right, and now you can do something with it. For example, you could send that person an email with a discount on those exact shoes—or maybe show them a special ad.

**Interviewer**: And you can measure if it works, can’t you?

**Interviewee**: That’s the best part. The tag tracks if they come back, use the coupon, and finally buy. Brands have seen double-digit jumps in conversion rates just by making their outreach this relevant.

**Interviewer**: So you’re using the data to meet people where they are—

**Interviewee**: —without being creepy about it, just smart and timely.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's get into privacy for a second. When you mention strict data siloing and client data ownership—what does that actually look like? How does it work? And, uh, why does it matter so much for brands now?

**Interviewee**: Oh, this is where things get interesting. So, strict data siloing? Picture it like—every client gets their own vault. No mixing, no peeking, nobody else’s data gets in.

**Interviewer**: Like a bank vault with individual lockboxes.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Epsilon keeps your brand’s data totally separate. They don’t sell it, don’t use it to train outside stuff, nothing. Every byte stays yours.

**Interviewer**: So, how do they actually make sure of that?

**Interviewee**: It’s locked down in three ways—technical barriers, legal contracts, and, get this, even third-party audits to double-check everything.

**Interviewer**: Wow, so it’s not just about keeping things tidy; there’s a lot at stake here.

**Interviewee**: Absolutely. Data is both power and a huge liability. If you’re a brand, you definitely don’t want your customers’ info leaking out or ending up with a competitor.

**Interviewer**: Especially now with all the new privacy laws popping up.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly. Owning your own data and making sure it's locked down—that’s not just a nice-to-have anymore. It’s survival. And, honestly, it’s how you build trust with customers. Nothing beats that.

**Interviewer**: Let’s talk about Epsilon’s CORE ID—you mentioned the move to first-party data. Can you break down how CORE ID actually works? And why is moving away from third-party cookies such a big deal?

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure. So, this is the hot topic right now. Epsilon’s CORE ID is their own identity solution. It pulls together all the ways someone interacts with a brand—

**Interviewer**: But only using first-party data, right? Not those sneaky third-party cookies?

**Interviewee**: Right! No cookies from other sites. CORE ID uses data the brand collects directly—site visits, purchases, even email opens—to build a privacy-safe ID for each user.

**Interviewer**: Why is that such a game-changer?

**Interviewee**: Well, third-party cookies are basically toast. Browsers are blocking them, and privacy advocates hate them. Brands that still rely on them are just... flying blind.

**Interviewer**: But with CORE ID and first-party data, you’re building real relationships, with consent, and you’re staying compliant.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And since CORE ID works across all devices and channels, you keep giving your customers that personal touch—even as the rules change.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s the way to keep your marketing sharp and—

**Interviewee**: —and your privacy game even sharper. That’s the future, really.

**Interviewer**: So, with third-party cookies disappearing, what's the biggest headache for brands trying to future-proof their tagging strategies?

**Interviewee**: Oh, it's huge. Losing third-party cookies is, well, a total game-changer for digital marketing.

**Interviewer**: Because that's how brands used to track people across different sites, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. That invisible, behind-the-scenes tracking—gone. Now, suddenly, brands have to get really good at collecting their own data.

**Interviewer**: You mean first-party data? Like, directly from their own users?

**Interviewee**: Yep, first-party data. But here's the thing—they need to do it without crossing privacy lines or creeping people out.

**Interviewer**: So, how do they actually pull that off? What does future-proofing look like now?

**Interviewee**: For starters, double down on consent. Be super clear and transparent. Build real relationships, not just data profiles.

**Interviewer**: That sounds tough. Are there tools that help with this?

**Interviewee**: Definitely. Take Epsilon’s CORE ID—it gives brands a persistent, privacy-safe way to recognize users, no cookies needed.

**Interviewer**: And what about working with publishers? Does that help?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, for sure. Partnering closely with publishers, or using things like reverse proxy setups, keeps data flowing—but keeps it compliant.

**Interviewer**: It sounds like brands have to be really nimble now. Ready to pivot all the time.

**Interviewee**: That's it. Be privacy-first, flexible, and always keep an eye on the rules. Own your data, respect your customers, and pick tech partners who live and breathe compliance.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's bring it home—if you had to boil all this down, what's the one thing brands should never forget about tagging?

**Interviewee**: Tagging isn’t just some technical chore or analytics checkbox.

**Interviewer**: It's the backbone, right? Of how brands understand and connect with their customers.

**Interviewee**: Yes! The best brands use tagging for real insight and personalization—but they never sacrifice privacy or trust to do it.

**Interviewer**: So, own your data, treat it like it's gold, and choose partners who care about compliance as much as innovation.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. The future is all about first-party relationships and privacy by design. Nail your tagging, and you’ll be ready—cookies or not.

**Interviewer**: So, if you look ahead—how do you see tagging changing, you know, especially with all these new privacy rules and tech upgrades? Is there anything on your radar that's either super exciting or, I dunno, maybe a little scary?

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally! I mean, the future of tagging? It's going to be a bit of a rollercoaster. Some parts are super exciting—like, I'm really into the whole server-side tagging thing.

**Interviewer**: Oh yeah? What's cool about that?

**Interviewee**: Well, it lets brands grab the insights they need, but without blasting personal data everywhere. And it's kind of future-proof, you know? With all the browser changes and new privacy laws popping up.

**Interviewer**: That sounds... actually really smart.

**Interviewee**: Yeah! And the buzz around AI-powered tag management? That could automate compliance checks, maybe even optimize data flows on the fly.

**Interviewer**: So, AI making sure you're not, like, accidentally breaking the law while you sleep?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! But honestly, the way regulations keep shifting—it's a blessing and a curse. Keeps everyone honest, but you can't just set it up and walk away.

**Interviewer**: So, you always have to keep an eye on it?

**Interviewee**: Right. If you get lazy, you risk collecting too much, or worse—accidental leaks. My advice? Jump into the new tech, put privacy front and center, and always audit what your tags are doing.

**Interviewer**: So, treat tagging like... an ongoing project, not just an IT box to tick?

**Interviewee**: Yes! The brands that see tagging as something alive, always changing, they're the ones that win.

**Interviewer**: Alright, for folks listening who want to get started, or maybe get deeper into tagging, where should they go? Any go-to resources or communities?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, for sure! If you’re new, I’d say start with the Google Tag Manager docs—they’re free, and honestly, pretty approachable.

**Interviewer**: YouTube too, right? There’s a ton there.

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally! Channels like MeasureSchool or Analytics Mania—they walk you through everything, step by step.

**Interviewer**: What about if someone wants to get, you know, more advanced?

**Interviewee**: Check out the Epsilon blog, or the IAB Tech Lab. They cover industry standards and all the latest on privacy. And Reddit’s r/analytics, plus the Measure Slack community—those are gold for real-world advice.

**Interviewer**: So, just dive in and try stuff?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Set up a sandbox, mess around, break things, learn by doing. That’s honestly the best way to get good at this.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
