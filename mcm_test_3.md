## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about MCM Test 3.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s get started. Can you break down for us—what does "multi-channel measurement" really mean in marketing these days? And, you know, why is everyone suddenly talking about it?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, sure thing. So, multi-channel measurement is basically about keeping tabs on how all your marketing channels are performing—everywhere, not just online. We’re talking emails, social media, display ads, search, even things like direct mail or when someone calls into a call center.

**Interviewer**: Wait, so it’s not just digital stuff?

**Interviewee**: No, not at all. It’s the whole picture. The way people shop now, they’re bouncing between websites, physical stores, maybe they see an ad on Instagram, then get a postcard, then call your support line. If you’re only tracking one piece, you’re missing how all those touchpoints work together to actually make a sale.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s kind of like… if you’re not measuring everything together, you’re missing the forest for the trees?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And if you don’t see the whole journey, you’re flying blind. You might spend too much on one channel or miss chances to really reach people where it matters.

**Interviewer**: Got it. So, with all these different channels, why does it matter so much to know which ones are really working? Isn’t it enough just to see big numbers at the end?

**Interviewee**: Oh, I wish it were that simple. If you only look at the total numbers, you can fool yourself into thinking every channel is pulling its weight. Or—

**Interviewer**: Or you end up giving all the credit to, I don’t know, the last ad someone saw before they bought?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! But the truth is, some channels are great at grabbing attention, while others are better at getting people to actually buy. If you don’t look at what’s really driving results, you end up wasting money on things that just look good on paper.

**Interviewer**: So, give me an example—

**Interviewee**: I’ve seen companies go all-in on flashy social ads, and then find out their customers were really convinced by a well-timed email, or even by visiting an actual store. Attribution helps you figure that out, so you can spend smarter and get better results.

**Interviewer**: Makes sense. So, it’s all about putting your dollars where they’ll actually make a difference.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s jump right in. When people hear "multi-channel attribution," uh, what are we actually talking about here? I mean, how’s that any different from just, you know, tracking conversions or clicks across channels?

**Interviewee**: Oh, good question. So, multi-channel attribution—or MCA—it's way more than just counting who clicked on what, or who ended up buying something. Think of it as connecting all the dots, right? Every single interaction someone has with your brand: opening an email, clicking a search ad, calling your support center, maybe even getting a postcard in the mail.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s not just online stuff, then?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! It’s everything. MCA tries to figure out what kind of impact each touchpoint had on the final decision. Regular tracking just tells you what happened—like, ‘hey, this person bought something.’ Attribution is trying to answer: ‘why did they buy?’ What actually influenced them? Which channel did the heavy lifting?

**Interviewer**: So, it’s less about counting clicks and more about understanding what really moved the needle?

**Interviewee**: Yes, exactly. It gives you a much clearer picture of which channels are actually working, not just which ones got the most clicks.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let’s talk about the customer journey, then. Can you walk me through, I don’t know, following a customer from their first interaction all the way to conversion? Especially if they’re jumping all over the place—mobile, desktop, calls, whatever.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, this is where it gets really interesting—and, honestly, a little tricky. So, picture someone shopping for a mortgage. They might see a display ad on their phone, then get an email the next day, maybe later they click a search ad on their laptop...

**Interviewer**: And then maybe they pick up the phone and call someone, or respond to a piece of direct mail?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Each of those things leaves a little breadcrumb. Advanced tools—like Epsilon’s CORE ID—can actually piece all those crumbs together, even if it’s across different devices.

**Interviewer**: So you can tell it’s the same person, even if they’re switching from phone to laptop to, I don’t know, calling your call center?

**Interviewee**: That’s the magic! You get the full story, not just a bunch of disconnected moments. Which means you can see which mix of channels actually led to the final conversion. And that lets you optimize—spend, creative, the whole thing.

**Interviewer**: Because the path isn’t a straight line, right? People zigzag all over the place.

**Interviewee**: Right, it’s almost never linear. But with multi-channel attribution, you finally get to see the real journey.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's dig into those attribution models you mentioned—first click, last click, weighted, data-driven. Can you kind of walk me through how each one really works? And maybe, you know, share where you've seen them shine… or totally flop?

**Interviewee**: Totally! So, first-click attribution—that's where all the credit goes to the very first touchpoint. It’s awesome for figuring out what first grabs someone’s attention, but… it ignores everything after, right?

**Interviewer**: So if someone sees an ad, clicks it, but then keeps coming back through other channels—those get zero credit?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And then last-click is the opposite. It gives all the credit to whatever happens right before someone finally converts. Super simple, but it usually means you’re overvaluing things like branded search or retargeting ads—those 'closers.'

**Interviewer**: Right, so it’s like the person who shows up for the final handshake gets all the praise, even if someone else did most of the work.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that’s a perfect way to put it. Now, weighted models—like linear or position-based—spread the credit across all the touchpoints. That’s fairer, but if your customer journey has, say, ten steps… the insights can get kinda watered down.

**Interviewer**: So you lose that sense of which channel was really moving the needle?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And then there’s data-driven models—the dream scenario. These use real journey data to figure out what actually influenced the conversion. They’re amazing… but you need tons of clean, granular data. And sometimes they’re a bit of a black box.

**Interviewer**: So you can’t always see why the model gave credit the way it did?

**Interviewee**: Right. But the cool part is, I’ve seen companies get totally surprised—channels they thought were just 'meh' end up being key drivers. But yeah, picking the right model really depends on your data maturity and your business goals.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so let’s talk about actually matching a single customer across all those channels. Why is getting identity alignment so hard in the real world?

**Interviewee**: Oh, identity alignment—that’s probably one of the hardest parts of multi-channel attribution. People use different info everywhere—they’ll open an email on their phone, then browse your site at work, click an ad on their tablet, and maybe even call your contact center. Every touchpoint might have a different cookie or device ID, or even a typo in their name.

**Interviewer**: So there’s no universal ID that just ties it all together?

**Interviewee**: Nope, not unless you build one yourself—like Epsilon’s CORE ID, for example. And then, don’t even get me started on offline stuff! Linking direct mail or in-store purchases to online behavior… that’s a whole new level of tricky.

**Interviewer**: So if you mess up identity—

**Interviewee**: —you either double-count people or miss them completely. And then your insights? Toast.

**Interviewer**: So really, investing in solid identity resolution isn’t optional if you want attribution you can trust.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It’s foundational. Otherwise, you’re just guessing—and you don’t want that.

**Interviewer**: So, you mentioned Epsilon's CORE ID as a solution earlier—can you break down for me, just how do people-based IDs like CORE ID actually work? And, I mean, what really makes them better than just tracking cookies or devices?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that's a great question. So, you know how with cookies, they're stuck to just one browser, or maybe a single device?

**Interviewer**: Right, so if I check my email on my phone, but then buy something later on my laptop—

**Interviewee**: —exactly! To the old tracking systems, that's two different people. But with something like CORE ID, it goes way beyond that. It brings together data from all sorts of places—emails, logins, even loyalty cards or offline purchases—

**Interviewer**: So it’s like, instead of following my phone or laptop, it’s following...well, me?

**Interviewee**: You've got it. It creates a profile that's actually tied to a real person, not just a gadget. So, even if you switch devices or go offline, the system can still recognize you.

**Interviewer**: And that means what, more accurate tracking?

**Interviewee**: Yeah—and not just tracking, but attribution. It helps brands see the full picture of what people do, where, and when. Plus, it's a lot more future-proof, especially as cookies are getting phased out.

**Interviewer**: Okay, but let’s dig into the nitty-gritty here. How do you actually connect, say, a phone call to a call center or a response to a direct mail, back to that same person you’re tracking online? What’s going on behind the curtain?

**Interviewee**: Oh, this is where things get both messy and kind of magical. So, to link offline stuff back to online profiles, you need a shared identifier—like, if someone calls in and gives their email, phone number, or maybe their loyalty ID, you can match that back to their online activity.

**Interviewer**: And with direct mail? How does that work?

**Interviewee**: Ah, so sometimes there’ll be a unique link, a personalized URL, or even a QR code in the mail—that connects straight back to the person. CORE ID basically pulls all these different sources—hashed emails, transaction records, even device fingerprints—

**Interviewer**: It’s like putting together a puzzle, right? Pieces from everywhere, digital and real world...

**Interviewee**: Yes! And when it all comes together, you finally see the customer’s full journey. But, honestly? It takes a lot of data hygiene and some serious engineering muscle to make sure all those pieces fit perfectly.

**Interviewer**: So, when you're bringing in data from all these different sources and tagging it, what are the biggest headaches you see marketers dealing with? And, uh, how do you usually help them avoid those messes?

**Interviewee**: Oh, onboarding and tagging data? That's where so many marketers just—hit the wall! The biggest headaches? Yeah, it's usually inconsistent data formats. One source calls it "Customer ID," another says "User_ID." And then you get missing tags, or incomplete data... and don't get me started on data silos.

**Interviewer**: Oh, data silos are the worst. You mean when teams just won't share info?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! It's like, your email team calls something "Campaign Name," but the web analytics folks use a totally different term. Then try stitching that together—it's a nightmare.

**Interviewer**: And if you miss tagging something important, you're basically flying blind, right?

**Interviewee**: Totally. If you skip a key event, you lose that whole chunk of the customer journey. My advice? Start with a thorough data audit. Seriously, check everything.

**Interviewer**: Audit first, got it. What else?

**Interviewee**: Standardize your naming conventions. Make sure everyone is on the same page about what things are called and how they're tracked. And—validate your tags. Religiously.

**Interviewer**: So, double-check everything, basically.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, and get all your teams aligned on what actually needs to be tracked, not just what’s easy. Oh—and please, don't skip documentation! When something breaks—and it will—good docs will save your sanity.

**Interviewer**: Okay, let’s switch gears. Event feeds—why is granular, timestamped event data, and having good ID mapping, so crucial for attribution? Got any stories where that level of detail really made a difference?

**Interviewee**: Granular, timestamped event data is the backbone of attribution. Without it, it’s like trying to solve a mystery with half the clues missing.

**Interviewer**: You mean, you can’t tell what actually influenced the customer?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. With detailed event feeds, you see the order and timing of every single interaction. That’s how you figure out: was it the ad, the follow-up email, or maybe that last-minute phone call that actually tipped the scales?

**Interviewer**: And that only works if you can tie all those events to the right person, not just a random device, right?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, solid ID mapping is key. I had a mortgage client, for example—we tracked every email open, web visit, and phone call. Sequencing that data, they realized their so-called "closing" channel was actually nurturing leads way earlier in the process.

**Interviewer**: So they were giving credit to the wrong channel all along?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Once they saw the real journey, they shifted their budget and—boom—conversion rates doubled. Without that detail? You're just guessing.

**Interviewer**: That’s wild. Makes you wonder how many marketers are still just... guessing.

**Interviewer**: So, when you’re talking about custom reporting and pulling in third-party tools... what do you see as the biggest perks? And, uh, where do teams usually hit snags? Any stories come to mind where this kind of flexibility really helped someone out?

**Interviewee**: Oh, custom reporting and integrations? That’s where things get interesting. The huge upside is... well, you can really slice the data any way your team— or your execs—want. One group might build these crazy-detailed Tableau dashboards, another pipes data right into their CRM, and some just blend it with their other analytics tools.

**Interviewer**: So it’s, like, you take raw numbers and—

**Interviewee**: Turn them into action, yeah! And quickly, too. But, look, it’s not all smooth sailing. Connecting systems can get pretty messy—APIs don’t always play nice, data formats clash, privacy rules pop up...

**Interviewer**: Right, so sometimes the tech just... doesn’t want to cooperate.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. But when it all comes together? It’s kind of magical. I’ve seen teams use custom dashboards to compare attribution models side by side, spot hidden synergies between channels—

**Interviewer**: Like, ‘Oh, this email campaign is actually helping search ads perform better’—

**Interviewee**: Yes! And even set up near-real-time budget shifts. That flexibility? It’s a real edge, if you can handle the plumbing behind it.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so you mentioned Tableau dashboards. What does a really great attribution dashboard look like? I mean, what features should marketers never skip?

**Interviewee**: Great question. A solid attribution dashboard in Tableau? First, it should make it super easy to compare models—first click, last click, data-driven... just flip a toggle and see how credit changes.

**Interviewer**: So you can see, at a glance, what’s driving results no matter how you slice it.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And you want to break down conversions and revenue by channel, campaign, audience segment—like, prospects versus existing customers. Visuals matter too: Sankey diagrams, journey flows... those help map out customer paths.

**Interviewer**: What about trends? Can you spot seasonality in there?

**Interviewee**: Definitely! Timeline views are great for that, seeing lag between touchpoints or spotting seasonal spikes. Oh, and diagnostic panels—alerts if you’re missing tags, have data gaps, or something’s really off the charts.

**Interviewer**: So the best dashboards basically tell you what’s working, what’s broken, and where to focus next—without needing a data science degree.

**Interviewee**: That’s the dream! Make it obvious, make it actionable—and get everyone on the same page, fast.

**Interviewer**: So, when you're looking at results from different attribution models or breaking things down by segment, what kinds of patterns—or surprises—should marketers be on the lookout for? Have you ever seen a case where just changing the model flipped everything on its head?

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure. Switching attribution models can really shatter your expectations. I've seen last-click make retargeting look like the superstar—

**Interviewer**: But then when you try something like data-driven—

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Suddenly, upper-funnel channels like display and social pop up as the real drivers behind conversions. It's wild.

**Interviewer**: So it's not always the channel you think that's doing the heavy lifting.

**Interviewee**: Right, right. And if you look at different customer segments, you see even more surprises. Prospects? They often need those top-of-funnel awareness channels. But existing customers—they'll convert from an email or just going direct.

**Interviewer**: Any stories where this really changed a team's strategy?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, there was a mortgage provider we worked with. They thought some leads were just dead. But when we actually looked closer—

**Interviewer**: Let me guess. The 'dead' leads weren't so dead?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! A well-timed direct mail piece brought them back. Last-click missed that completely. So, the big lesson: Don't get too comfy with one model or one way to slice your segments. What looks weak in one view could be your secret weapon in another.

**Interviewer**: That makes sense. Can you walk us through a real-world situation where cross-channel attribution actually changed a company's marketing strategy or ROI? Like, what did they find, and how did they use it?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, let me go back to that mortgage provider story—it's a perfect example. They were running digital ads, email, direct mail, even a call center. The old last-click model said, 'Hey, paid search is king,' so all the money went there.

**Interviewer**: And the other channels just got ignored?

**Interviewee**: Pretty much. But then we brought in cross-channel attribution—using Epsilon's CORE ID, actually—and it changed everything. Suddenly, those display ads and direct mail? They were the sparks that got people interested.

**Interviewer**: So those channels were doing the heavy lifting early on?

**Interviewee**: Right, exactly. And the call center—that was where deals got closed. Tableau dashboards made it all super clear. It showed that those 'assist' channels, the ones nobody paid much attention to, actually deserved way more budget.

**Interviewer**: Did the team actually shift their spend?

**Interviewee**: Oh, they did. They started investing in early touchpoints, reworked their messaging for each stage. Not only did ROI go up, but the customer experience got a whole lot better. It was a total strategy reboot, all because they finally saw the real path to conversion.

**Interviewer**: So, if you look back at everything we've covered today—what would you say are, like, the non-negotiables for marketers who really want to master multi-channel attribution and, you know, actually get better ROI?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that's a big one. Okay, first thing—identity resolution. And by that I mean people-based IDs, not just... cookies or devices.

**Interviewer**: So, actually knowing who's who, right? Across all those channels.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Second, you need super detailed, timestamped event data. Every touchpoint—online, offline, you name it.

**Interviewer**: Wait, even offline stuff? Like, in-store events?

**Interviewee**: Yep, all of it. Third, you just can't ignore tagging standards or data hygiene. I mean, if your data's messy, forget about insights.

**Interviewer**: So, no shortcuts on cleaning up the data. Got it.

**Interviewee**: Fourth—flexible reporting tools. Tableau, Power BI, whatever lets you actually see, slice, and act on what’s happening.

**Interviewer**: So you’re saying, don’t just collect data—make sure you can actually use it.

**Interviewee**: Right. And last thing? Stay curious. Always question your assumptions. Try different models, dig into the weird segments, and let the data surprise you.

**Interviewer**: I love that. If you skip any of those, you’re basically—

**Interviewee**: —leaving money on the table. Or, worse, optimizing for the wrong thing entirely!

**Interviewer**: So, looking ahead—what trends or tech do you think will shake up attribution and measurement in the next couple years?

**Interviewee**: Oh, it's about to get interesting. First, with third-party cookies dying, everyone’s scrambling for better people-based IDs and first-party data. Think, more investments in clean rooms, identity graphs, hashed PII.

**Interviewer**: And that’s all about privacy, right? Compliance and all that?

**Interviewee**: Totally. Plus, AI and machine learning are getting a lot better—at connecting journeys, finding patterns, even predicting who’ll convert next.

**Interviewer**: So we’ll see smarter attribution, but also safer? More privacy-first?

**Interviewee**: Yep, solutions like differential privacy or federated learning—those are going to be everywhere, I think.

**Interviewer**: And what about offline? Brick-and-mortar, IoT stuff?

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure! As more IoT and in-store tech comes online, we’ll finally be able to link those real-world signals with digital journeys.

**Interviewer**: So, the future’s all about smarter, safer, and truly... omnichannel measurement.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. The next few years are going to be wild.

**Interviewer**: Alright, before we finish up, let me ask you this—if you could give marketers just one piece of advice for, you know, taking attribution insights and actually turning them into real-world ROI... what would it be?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that's a good one. I’d say, don’t just let your attribution reports sit there and collect dust.

**Interviewer**: You mean, don’t just build dashboards for the sake of it?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! It’s so easy to get caught up in building these fancy dashboards and running all sorts of analyses, but then... people just go back to business as usual.

**Interviewer**: So the magic happens only when you actually do something with the data, right?

**Interviewee**: Yes! If the numbers show that an 'assist' channel is being undervalued, don’t be afraid to move some budget there—even if it feels, you know, a little risky.

**Interviewer**: And if a segment’s underperforming, you’d suggest... changing the messaging?

**Interviewee**: Or even adjusting the funnel. The point is to test, learn, and keep iterating. Attribution isn’t this one-and-done thing. It’s alive. It keeps evolving.

**Interviewer**: So real ROI comes from being willing to shake things up based on what you find, not just admiring those beautiful charts?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Be bold. Take the insights and actually use them. That’s where the real value comes from.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
