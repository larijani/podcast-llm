## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about IE Features.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let's just dive right in—could you, uh, give us a quick rundown of what Identity Essentials actually is? And, you know, why is it suddenly such a big deal for marketers?

**Interviewee**: Oh, yeah. So, Identity Essentials is really Epsilon’s answer to the whole mess of scattered customer data. Basically, it's this portable identity and data solution—it's powered by something called CORE ID—

**Interviewer**: CORE ID? That sounds pretty fancy—

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it's kind of the engine behind the whole thing. What it does is help brands get this really connected, persistent view of each person, no matter what channel they're using. So, web, in-store, app—

**Interviewer**: Wait, so it actually ties all those together?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And that matters because, I mean, most marketers are dealing with, well, let's just say a lot of patchy data. You might recognize someone on your website, but have no clue who they are in your app.

**Interviewer**: Or in-store! I always wondered about that.

**Interviewee**: Right! So with Identity Essentials, you can finally stitch all those pieces together. It gives you a fuller picture of each customer, and then—here’s the cool part—you can actually use that to personalize what they see, and also measure how well your marketing is working. And, you don’t have to rip out your whole marketing stack to do it.

**Interviewer**: So it's about, what, making identity work for you, instead of you chasing after it all the time?

**Interviewee**: That’s exactly it.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so you mentioned all this patchy, incomplete data. What does that actually look like for a marketer, you know, on a normal day?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? It's a bit of a nightmare. Most of the time, marketers are sort of flying blind. You might get an email from someone signing up on the web, but then you don’t have their phone number. Or, maybe you only have a name and an address from a loyalty program.

**Interviewer**: So, basically, you’re always missing something?

**Interviewee**: Always. And people are all over the place—mobile, email, in-store—and none of that data just connects automatically. So you end up with, like, five different profiles for the same person, and you can’t tell who’s who.

**Interviewer**: That must make targeting a nightmare.

**Interviewee**: It really does. You can’t personalize offers if you don’t even know it’s the same person browsing your site and opening your emails. Plus, it means you're wasting money—sending the wrong messages, missing high-value customers altogether.

**Interviewer**: That sounds... wow, super frustrating! So, what actually happens if brands don’t fix these identity and data messes?

**Interviewee**: Let’s just say—it’s not pretty. If you don’t get control over identity and your data’s all over the place, things start to unravel fast.

**Interviewer**: How so? Are we talking just some annoying emails, or—

**Interviewee**: Worse than that! Customers get bombarded with the same messages, or get offers that make zero sense to them. That wrecks trust.

**Interviewer**: I hate when that happens. So it really damages the relationship?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Plus, you can’t tell what’s working. Every marketing decision? Kinda just a shot in the dark.

**Interviewer**: So, no way to optimize campaigns. That’s gotta hurt.

**Interviewee**: Big time. And on top of that, you can’t innovate because you’re only seeing fragments of the customer journey. Meanwhile, your competitors—

**Interviewer**: —are figuring it out and just stealing your lunch.

**Interviewee**: Yep! In the worst cases, your brand reputation takes a hit. People expect brands to understand them now. Messing this up isn’t just a tech fail—it’s risky business.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let’s talk solutions. Can you break down what goes into Identity Essentials? What are the main pieces, and how do they actually fix these headaches?

**Interviewee**: Sure! There are a few big building blocks. First up: Resolution & Hygiene. That’s all about cleaning up and stitching together scattered customer records into one clean profile.

**Interviewer**: So, you’re merging duplicates and kicking out the bad data?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Next, Enrichment. That’s filling in missing info—like adding addresses or behavioral signals to flesh out the profiles.

**Interviewer**: So you’re turning a sketch into a real portrait of the customer.

**Interviewee**: Right. Then there’s Real-Time Recognition. That’s where you instantly spot a customer when they land on your site or app—super helpful for personalization.

**Interviewer**: So you know who you’re talking to, right from the start.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! After that, Activation. That’s using those rich profiles in all your channels—email, social, wherever you reach customers.

**Interviewer**: And then you can actually measure what’s working—

**Interviewee**: With Attribution & Measurement. That ties everything back together so you see which actions drive results. The best part? You don’t have to rip out your whole tech stack—this plugs right in and makes your data smarter.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s about making everything you already have work better—no need to start from scratch.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It’s about making identity data actually work for you, not against you.

**Interviewer**: So, can you paint a picture for us—what does it actually look like when a brand takes all their scattered customer data and turns it into something useful with Identity Essentials? How do those pieces really work together?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, let me set the scene. Imagine a retailer. Their data is all over the place—website logins, checkout registers, email lists, loyalty apps... you name it.

**Interviewer**: Right, so a total mess at first.

**Interviewee**: Total mess, exactly! First up, Resolution & Hygiene jumps in. It grabs all those customer records, finds the duplicates—so, you know, if 'Jane Doe' shows up three times, it's actually just one person—and cleans up any errors.

**Interviewer**: So kind of like... digital spring cleaning?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that's it. Then Enrichment steps in. Say Jane's email is missing, or her purchase history is incomplete—Enrichment fills those gaps, maybe even adds lifestyle info.

**Interviewer**: So you're not just cleaning, you're adding details?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Then, when Jane visits the site again, Real-Time Recognition spots her right away. The brand can instantly serve her personalized offers or experiences.

**Interviewer**: So the retailer actually knows it's Jane, not just a random visitor.

**Interviewee**: Yep, and all that rich data can now fuel campaigns—plus, with Attribution, the brand finally sees which messages or channels actually worked. It's really going from chaos to clarity. Each step builds on the last.

**Interviewer**: Okay, let's dive into that first step—Resolution & Hygiene. What's really happening under the hood to clean up all those messy records? Can you walk us through the nuts and bolts?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, let's get into it! Resolution & Hygiene is kind of the janitor and the detective, all-in-one. It grabs raw data—Customer IDs, names, emails, addresses, whatever's available.

**Interviewer**: So, all the messy pieces coming in at once?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Then, it uses identity resolution tech to match up records—even if the info's a little different. So 'J. Doe,' 'Jane A. Doe,' 'Jane Doe' at the same address? Those get stitched together into one profile.

**Interviewer**: So it's not fooled by a missing middle initial or a typo?

**Interviewee**: Nope, that's the detective part. Then comes the janitor: it cleans everything up. Tools like CASS and NCOA make sure addresses are accurate, fix typos, update info, and flag things like opt-outs or people who've moved.

**Interviewer**: And the output?

**Interviewee**: A clean, deduped, compliant data set. Every person or household gets a unique ID.

**Interviewer**: And this can happen in real time, or with big batch uploads?

**Interviewee**: Exactly—either way, the data stays fresh and usable. It's not glamorous work, but if you skip this step, none of the fancy stuff works.

**Interviewer**: Okay—so after you've dealt with Resolution and Hygiene, the next step is enrichment, right? And that's where "Contact Complete" comes in. Can you walk me through how that actually works? Like, what sort of gaps is it filling for marketers?

**Interviewee**: Sure thing. So, you know how marketers often get stuck with these half-finished customer profiles?

**Interviewer**: Oh yeah. Like, you have an email but nothing else—

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Or maybe just a phone number, or maybe just a name and a ZIP code. What Contact Complete does is—it takes whatever little bit you have, and then it goes out and fills in the blanks. So, you might end up with their full name, a physical address, or even another way to reach them, like an email if you only had a phone number to start.

**Interviewer**: So it's sort of like... reverse engineering a whole profile from just a couple of clues?

**Interviewee**: That's a good way to put it! And on average, we're able to fill out, what, fifty percent more of those incomplete records, which is honestly kind of wild.

**Interviewer**: That's a huge difference. And for marketers, that means what—better matching for campaigns?

**Interviewee**: Right. You get way more people matched for digital campaigns—I'm talking five to ten percent higher match rates for media. And you can finally reach folks through channels you couldn't before, like direct mail.

**Interviewer**: So, less wasted potential. You're actually making use of all those records instead of just—

**Interviewee**: Exactly. You're not leaving people on the table anymore. And you also get a much clearer picture of who your customers actually are, which totally changes your approach to targeting and personalization.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so let's talk about real-time recognition for a second. How does Identity Essentials actually identify a site visitor right away? And what does that unlock for marketers?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, this is honestly one of my favorite features. So, imagine someone comes to your site—no login, maybe even totally anonymous. The system's looking at things like device signals, cookies, sometimes hashed emails, and cross-checking all that with the CORE ID graph.

**Interviewer**: So even if you don't have a full profile yet...

**Interviewee**: Exactly! IE can still pull in, like, over eight hundred attributes—demographics, lifestyle stuff, interests. So you can start personalizing from the very first visit, not just for people you already know.

**Interviewer**: Can you give an example of what that actually looks like?

**Interviewee**: Totally. Let's say a new visitor lands on a retail site. Identity Essentials picks up that they're probably a young parent, based on household signals.

**Interviewer**: So the site instantly swaps out the generic banners—

**Interviewee**: —for family promos, discounts on kids’ clothes, that sort of thing. And that kind of quick personalization? We've seen it drive a fifteen percent lift in conversions, sometimes even three to five times more personalization opportunities.

**Interviewer**: That's a big deal. It's like—

**Interviewee**: —flipping on a light switch for marketers who were basically working in the dark. Exactly!

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s jump right in—activation. How does Identity Essentials actually help brands take these unified profiles and, you know, put them to work? Across all those different channels, I mean.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, so, this is where it gets exciting. You’ve spent all this time building these rich, unified profiles, right? The big question is—now what?

**Interviewer**: Yeah, what do you actually do with them?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! That’s where IE comes in. It lets you push those audiences out to, well, everywhere you want—paid media, email, social, direct mail, your personalization tools, you name it.

**Interviewer**: But it’s more than just pushing a list, right?

**Interviewee**: Way more. See, IE doesn’t just dump your data. It lines up your first-party data with the ID systems your partners use—think Google, Meta, CTV platforms. And—here’s the key—it uses deterministic matches, not just fuzzy logic.

**Interviewer**: So you’re saying you actually know who you’re reaching?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, and you reach way more of your real audience. I mean, we’re talking two to three times more, sometimes. You avoid hitting the same person over and over, and you don’t waste money on the wrong impressions.

**Interviewer**: I’ve heard from brands who get frustrated with low match rates. I bet you hear that too?

**Interviewee**: All the time! Brands struggle with data that just doesn’t line up, and they end up wasting ad spend. With IE, they get better match rates, more accurate targeting, and, honestly, campaigns that just work harder. It’s about making every campaign dollar count—because you’re reaching real people, not just random devices.

**Interviewer**: Let’s shift gears—attribution and measurement. Once you’ve activated all these channels, how does Identity Essentials help brands actually connect the dots? Between what they do in marketing and what happens in the real world?

**Interviewee**: Oh, this is the fun part. Once you’ve stitched together all those touchpoints—website, email, in-store, whatever—you get to actually see the whole customer journey. IE creates this persistent customer ID, so you know who saw what ad, who clicked which email, who went in-store and bought something.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not just ‘we ran a campaign and conversions went up’—you actually know who did what?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Like, take a CPG brand—they run a display campaign, then use IE to track who saw the ad, who visited their site, who used a coupon. Instead of guessing, you can say, ‘This group saw the ad and converted.’ It’s real attribution.

**Interviewer**: That sounds like a game-changer for optimization.

**Interviewee**: It really is! You’re not flying blind anymore. You’re basically giving your marketing team a GPS so they can steer towards what actually works.

**Interviewer**: So, let’s get into integration—how does Identity Essentials actually fit into the tech a brand already has? I mean, if someone’s using a CDP or a data warehouse, or, you know, some personalization tool… what does that setup even look like?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, great question—and honestly, nobody wants to hear, ‘Sorry, you’ve gotta throw out what you’re using and start over.’ That’s just—no. Identity Essentials is designed to work with whatever you’ve already got.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s not a rip-and-replace situation?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. We play nice with your stack. Whether you’re on a CDP, a data warehouse, or working with a personalization platform, we’ve got options. There’s batch uploads—like S3 drops—APIs for real-time data, or even direct connections to the big-name CDPs and analytics tools.

**Interviewer**: Wait, so the setup… is it complicated? Or—

**Interviewee**: Honestly, it’s flexible. You just pass over your customer records—usually with PII—and then you pick how you want to get your results back. Most clients are up and running in, what, four to six weeks?

**Interviewer**: That’s fast.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, the whole point is to make your identity data smarter, not make you rebuild your whole tech stack. Super seamless, super modular.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s shift gears a bit. You mentioned PII, so—privacy and compliance. With all this sensitive info flying around, how does Identity Essentials actually handle stuff like opt-out requests or deletes? And what safeguards are in place to keep data secure and compliant?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that’s a huge one. And nowadays, it’s not optional, right? Privacy and compliance—they’re baked in from the start.

**Interviewer**: So, if someone says, ‘Hey, delete my data’…

**Interviewee**: Yup, whether it’s for GDPR, CCPA, or just a customer saying, ‘I want out,’ we’ve built workflows to handle those requests quickly and completely. Records get suppressed or deleted everywhere they’re connected, not just on the surface.

**Interviewer**: And on the security side?

**Interviewee**: We’re talking full encryption—at rest and in transit—tight access controls, audit trails, all of it. Plus, data hygiene isn’t just about tidying up typos. It’s about honoring preferences, removing deceased or opt-out records, and making sure only compliant data gets activated.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not a set-and-forget kind of thing?

**Interviewee**: No way. Compliance is ongoing—regular audits, updates for new regulations. If you slip up here, it’s not just about fines. You risk losing customer trust. And that’s game over.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's dig into some real-world impact. Have you got a recent story—a brand, maybe—that used Identity Essentials and really transformed things?

**Interviewee**: Oh, definitely. One that really jumps out? There was this national retailer, right? They were basically drowning in duplicate profiles—so much messy data.

**Interviewer**: Messy data—so, like, the same person was showing up twice, or even more?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And their contact info was all over the place. They were wasting a ton of money, showing the same ads to the same people—sometimes missing people completely.

**Interviewer**: That sounds...pretty frustrating. So, what happened after they brought in Identity Essentials?

**Interviewee**: Well, after rolling it out, they managed to cut duplicate profiles by 25%. And—get this—they saw campaign waste drop by half. Practically overnight.

**Interviewer**: Wait, half? That’s huge! But was that the biggest shift?

**Interviewee**: Actually, no—the real game-changer was profile enrichment and real-time recognition. Their match rates? Went up by five times. And their digital reach? Doubled.

**Interviewer**: That’s wild. So suddenly, they could actually—

**Interviewee**: —personalize offers to real people, not just devices. And it worked! They got a 15% lift in conversions on their site.

**Interviewer**: So it went from, like, guessing to knowing exactly who converted and why.

**Interviewee**: Yes! That level of clarity—it’s priceless. They finally had answers, not just hunches.

**Interviewer**: Okay, now, thinking big-picture: what should marketers remember if they're considering Identity Essentials? Any, uh, quick-start advice?

**Interviewee**: If there’s one thing? Connected identity isn’t a nice-to-have anymore—it’s the foundation. With IE, you get clean data, bigger audiences, real personalization, and you keep privacy front and center.

**Interviewer**: So, first step—

**Interviewee**: —get brutally honest about your data mess. Really look at what’s missing, what’s broken.

**Interviewer**: And bring in your privacy and IT folks early, right? Not just the marketing team.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Don’t try to make it perfect before you start. Start small, show the value, then scale. This stuff pays off fast—don’t let complexity hold you back.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so, looking ahead—what's coming up for Identity Essentials? Anything on the horizon that you're, you know, genuinely excited about? Features, trends—stuff marketers really shouldn't miss?

**Interviewee**: Oh, yeah, definitely. The roadmap's honestly buzzing right now. For starters, we're doubling down on real-time—so, totally instant recognition and audience updates, right as people interact with your brand.

**Interviewer**: Wait, so, you mean, like, while they're still browsing or even in-store?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Online, offline—doesn't matter. Updates happen right then and there. And there's a ton of excitement about AI-driven enrichment, too.

**Interviewer**: AI enrichment? You mean, filling in missing data, or—

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that, and more. Machine learning starts predicting what’s missing, and even suggests next moves for you. It’s like, your data gets smarter as you go.

**Interviewer**: That sounds kind of game-changing, honestly.

**Interviewee**: It is! And, big trend—tighter integrations with cloud data warehouses, CDPs… So brands can actually use identity data, without extra steps or delays.

**Interviewer**: So, less jumping between platforms, more just… activating?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And, of course, privacy is huge. Expect way more automation—consent, rights management, compliance, all getting easier as new regulations come in.

**Interviewer**: So, smarter, faster, and safer. Not bad.

**Interviewee**: That’s the future: smarter identity, more connected, with privacy right at the heart. It means marketers can keep up with their customers—not just chase after them.

**Interviewer**: Alright, last one for you—if you had to sum up the real impact of Identity Essentials for a marketing team, in, say, one or two sentences… what’s the one thing you want folks to remember after this episode?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? Identity Essentials is what separates guessing from actually knowing. It takes all your messy, scattered data and gives you this super clear, actionable view of each customer.

**Interviewer**: So, the right message, to the right person, at the right time?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And you can finally measure what works. If you take one thing away, it’s that IE turns identity chaos into clarity—and that’s how you unlock real personalization and performance, stuff you just can’t do with fragmented data.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
