## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about Sleep 7.

**Interviewer**: So, we all know sleep matters, right? But can you break down—why is it such a huge deal for kids and parents? What are we really risking if nobody’s getting enough good sleep?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it’s... honestly, it’s everything. Sleep is kind of the foundation for all health—kids and adults. If kids miss sleep, you’ll see it right away: they get grumpy, or—

**Interviewer**: Or they get sick more, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Their immune systems take a hit. Plus, their memory, learning, all of that goes downhill. Suddenly, little things set them off.

**Interviewer**: And it’s not just the kids, is it? Parents suffer too.

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure. When parents are sleep-deprived, patience goes out the window. You snap more. It’s like—you’re just surviving, not really living. The whole house feels it.

**Interviewer**: More fights, more stress. Less fun, less connection.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly! It’s not just about feeling tired. It’s about well-being, safety, even long-term health. Good sleep really can change everything for a family.

**Interviewer**: I bet a lot of listeners are nodding along right now. So, what are the biggest bedtime battles you see? And are there any myths out there you wish you could bust?

**Interviewee**: Oh, so many! Classic one—kids stalling. You know, "Just one more story," "Can I have some water?"—

**Interviewer**: Endless bathroom trips, right?

**Interviewee**: Yes! Or being scared of the dark, or not wanting to be alone. But here’s the thing: it’s easy to blame the kids, like, "Oh, they’re just being difficult." But that’s hardly ever the whole truth.

**Interviewer**: What’s really happening, then?

**Interviewee**: A lot of times, kids are picking up on our stress. Or maybe their bodies just aren’t ready to sleep yet. And people think—

**Interviewer**: If you just find the perfect routine, then bedtime is easy?

**Interviewee**: Right! But it’s never that simple. Bedtime is emotional—kids, parents, everyone brings their own feelings to it. Stress, exhaustion, even resentment. Kids totally sense all of that.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s not just the routine, it’s the whole emotional vibe at the end of the day.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! That’s where so many people get stuck.

**Interviewer**: So both you and your co-author are occupational therapists. You talk about this holistic approach to sleep—can you walk me through what that actually looks like? I mean, how do you bring in things like the body, mind, heart, and spirit when you’re helping families whose kids are struggling with bedtime?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, yeah, I love that you asked that. Because when we say 'holistic,' we really mean zooming out—looking at the whole kid, not just the bedtime battles.

**Interviewer**: So, not just whether they brush their teeth or get into bed on time...

**Interviewee**: Exactly! For the 'body,' we might help families find calming sensory activities, or routines that settle the nervous system. Stuff like deep-pressure hugs, or dimming the lights—it’s about helping the body wind down.

**Interviewer**: And the mind? That’s, what, the racing thoughts at bedtime?

**Interviewee**: Yes! Kids can have anxious thoughts or busy brains. We teach settling strategies—maybe guided imagery, or even little calm-down scripts.

**Interviewer**: Scripts? Like what—"Imagine you’re floating on a cloud," that kind of thing?

**Interviewee**: Exactly, or picturing a favorite place. For the 'heart,' it’s the emotional connection. We help families find rituals—special goodnight phrases, maybe reconnecting after a tough day.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s not just about sleep, it’s about feeling safe and loved.

**Interviewee**: That’s it. And with 'spirit,' it’s the deeper comfort. For some families that’s prayer or blessings, for others it’s just instilling a sense of being cherished. All these pieces work together—kids aren’t robots, right?

**Interviewer**: Ha, not at all!

**Interviewee**: If you only address one piece, it usually falls apart. We want bedtime to feel safe and nurturing from every direction.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so let’s talk numbers. There’s so much info out there—how much sleep do kids actually need at different ages? And why do those numbers matter so much?

**Interviewee**: Yes, this comes up all the time! So, newborns? They need about 14-17 hours over 24 hours. That’s broken up over naps and night.

**Interviewer**: Fourteen to seventeen—that’s a lot! And then it drops as they get older, right?

**Interviewee**: Right. Toddlers need 11 to 14 hours, preschoolers around 10 to 13, and school-age kids 9 to 12. By the time you get to teens, they still need 8 to 10—but most get way less.

**Interviewer**: Oh, for sure. My niece is a zombie before school every morning.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And these numbers aren’t just made up—they’re what kids’ brains and bodies need for growing, for learning, for handling emotions.

**Interviewer**: So, if they don’t get enough...

**Interviewee**: Yeah, you see more meltdowns, trouble focusing, getting sick more. It’s wild—sometimes you can literally see a kid’s mood or memory just tank after a week of bad sleep.

**Interviewer**: It’s like their batteries are running low.

**Interviewee**: That’s the perfect image—sleep is how they recharge!

**Interviewer**: So, how do parents actually spot sleep problems in their kids? I mean, it's not always just yawning, right?

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally. Kids don't always show it by just being tired. Sometimes they're... well, super irritable, or suddenly hyper—but almost clumsy with it.

**Interviewer**: Yeah? So, like, bouncing off the walls but then tripping over their own feet?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Or struggling with the little stuff—like getting dressed, or, you know, leaving the house without a meltdown.

**Interviewer**: That sounds familiar. What about things like getting sick a lot, or having trouble focusing?

**Interviewee**: That's a big one. If your kid's always catching colds, can't pay attention, or just seems extra defiant, those are big red flags. And honestly, it goes for parents, too.

**Interviewer**: Oh, you mean, like if we're reaching for coffee all day and snapping at everyone?

**Interviewee**: Yes! Or just feeling foggy, like you can't quite get going. Sometimes you don't notice until you hit that wall of exhaustion.

**Interviewer**: So it's not just about being tired—it’s how everyone’s actually functioning, day to day.

**Interviewee**: Right. It's more about how life feels—if everything’s harder than it should be, sleep could be the culprit.

**Interviewer**: Okay, let's talk about the body side of things. What can parents do to help their kids wind down, especially if they're, you know, super sensitive or just full of energy?

**Interviewee**: Great question. For those kids, routine is everything. Our bodies really crave predictability.

**Interviewer**: So, like, same thing every night?

**Interviewee**: Yep. About an hour or two before bed, start turning down the lights, screens off, maybe drop the thermostat a bit.

**Interviewer**: I've heard about weighted blankets—do those work?

**Interviewee**: For some kids, absolutely. Deep pressure—like weighted blankets, tight sheets, big bear hugs—it can be magic. Others do better with gentle rocking or soft music.

**Interviewer**: But not every kid likes baths, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. If a bath gets them all wound up, skip it. Maybe just wipe hands and feet, and save the shower for the morning.

**Interviewer**: And what about letting them pick their pajamas, or their favorite stuffed animal?

**Interviewee**: That can really help! Let them choose what feels cozy, adjust covers or pillows until it feels just right. Sensory stuff matters—a lot.

**Interviewer**: So, ask them what feels good or what’s bugging them?

**Interviewee**: Yes, and keep tweaking from there. Every kid is different, so finding their perfect bedtime routine is all about troubleshooting together.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let's dig into the 'mind' part for a second—because, y'know, so many kids just have these wild, busy brains, especially at bedtime. It’s like, as soon as the lights go out, suddenly every thought comes rushing in.

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally. It’s like their brains hit turbo mode the minute you want them to sleep. I see it all the time.

**Interviewer**: Yeah! So what can parents actually do to help when their kid’s mind is all over the place at night?

**Interviewee**: Well, I think one of the best tricks is giving their mind something gentle to land on. Like, maybe they draw for a couple minutes, or they read quietly, or even fiddle with a little toy under the covers.

**Interviewer**: So, like—just a little focus, not something super exciting, right?

**Interviewee**: Right, exactly! Nothing that's going to wake them up more, just something calming. And guided imagery helps too. You know, ask them to picture they're floating on a cloud, or maybe walking through a place they love.

**Interviewer**: Oh, so kind of like a bedtime story, but in their head?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, or you can do it together. Sometimes, if they're anxious, just naming the worry out loud can shrink it down to size. Like, 'Hey, I'm thinking about this test,' and suddenly it’s not as scary.

**Interviewer**: Oh, I love that. And you mentioned the thing about the stuffed animal—protecting it.

**Interviewee**: Yes! If they’re nervous, get them to look after a scared stuffed animal. It shifts their focus and makes them feel strong, instead of worried.

**Interviewer**: That’s brilliant. And are there nights where just chatting about their day helps too?

**Interviewee**: Definitely. Sometimes, all you really need is a silly book or a quick talk-through of what happened that day. It breaks the spiral, y’know?

**Interviewer**: So, it’s really about figuring out what calms your kid’s unique mind?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. No two kids are the same—you just have to experiment a little, see what works for them.

**Interviewer**: Alright, can we switch gears to talk about 'heart' now? You say that’s all about emotional connection and security at bedtime. What are some of your go-to ways for parents to give that to their kids, especially after one of those really rough, chaotic days?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? It’s all about the little rituals. Even if you’ve had the worst day, just a couple minutes of snuggling or talking about the best and hardest parts can totally reset things.

**Interviewer**: And sometimes kids just… need to know you still like them, right? Even after a tough day.

**Interviewee**: Yes! Even a silly handshake, or a special song, or tracing a heart on their back—it can feel like magic to them.

**Interviewer**: And if you’re totally wiped out as a parent?

**Interviewee**: Oh, just being honest is enough. Say, 'I'm tired, but I love you and I'm here.' That’s huge for a kid.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not about being perfect, it’s just those tiny, everyday moments?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Those little, steady things? That’s what builds real security and connection.

**Interviewer**: So, we've covered the body, mind, and heart stuff... but I'm curious, how do you bring in that "spirit" piece at bedtime? Especially for kids who get anxious or start asking those big questions about safety at night?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that's such a good point! Bedtime really is when kids get, I don't know, just... more open, right? Vulnerable.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, it's like the world gets quiet and suddenly all the big feelings come out.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And that's the perfect opportunity for spiritual connection. Some families pray together, others might sing a gentle hymn, or just talk about how God—or, you know, whatever you believe in—loves and protects them.

**Interviewer**: Almost like wrapping them up in a blessing, not just a blanket.

**Interviewee**: Yes, that's it! I've even seen families pick a simple Bible verse—something like, "When I am afraid, I put my trust in You"—and they say it together every night.

**Interviewer**: Oh, that's sweet. Like a little mantra.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And, honestly, even something as simple as a special nightlight, calling it their "God light" or something... it gives them that sense of being watched over.

**Interviewer**: Because it's not just about the light, it's the meaning behind it.

**Interviewee**: Right, you're letting them know they're never alone, and all those big feelings—they're safe with you, and safe with God.

**Interviewer**: And those rituals, they probably stick with kids longer than we think, huh?

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure. Sometimes those little spiritual habits become the anchor—not just for bedtime, but for all of life's storms.

**Interviewer**: Okay, switching gears—let's talk about the tough stuff. The dreaded night wakings. What can parents do at, say, two in the morning when their kid just won't settle?

**Interviewee**: Oh, those 2 a.m. wake-ups! They can feel... endless, can't they?

**Interviewer**: Yes! And it's so easy to accidentally make things worse.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. I always say: keep your response super boring and consistent. No new stories, no snacks, nothing exciting. Just calm, quick check-ins.

**Interviewer**: So, like, go in, reassure them, but don't start a whole party?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, you're just helping them settle, not giving them a reason to wake up for extra fun. And if you need to check in, try spacing it out a bit more each time, like you would at bedtime.

**Interviewer**: What about if they suddenly want you to rock them or lay down with them in the middle of the night?

**Interviewee**: If you don't do that at bedtime, don't start now. Stick to your routine. Consistency is key.

**Interviewer**: And bathroom requests? Those always seem to come up at 2 a.m.

**Interviewee**: Totally. Prep ahead—make sure they can go on their own if possible. And honestly, if everyone's just exhausted, it's okay to just get through the night and try again tomorrow. Progress, not perfection!

**Interviewer**: So, let’s talk about bedtime—especially for kids who, you know, have really strong reactions to stuff like pajamas, bright lights, or weird sounds at night. Or the ones who get super anxious if anything about the routine changes.

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally. Some kids are just, I mean, like little Goldilockses, right? Everything’s gotta be just so.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, like pajamas feel wrong, or the light’s too bright, or... the tiniest noise sets them off.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! So, one thing I always suggest is—if pajamas feel weird, just skip 'em. Let them sleep in their clothes, or even go without if that’s what feels best.

**Interviewer**: Really? That’s allowed?

**Interviewee**: Who’s gonna know, right? The Pajama Police? No, seriously, it’s about what works. And then stuff like soft lamps, white noise, blackout curtains—those can make a huge difference.

**Interviewer**: Oh! I bet deep pressure helps too? Like, those weighted blankets everyone’s talking about?

**Interviewee**: Yes! Or even just a pillow squish, or a little massage. Anything that helps their body chill out.

**Interviewer**: And what about all that brushing teeth and hair stuff? That’s gotta be hard when they’re tired.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Do it earlier, before they’re wiped out and cranky. And if something about the routine is going to change—let them know ahead of time. A little visual schedule can really help.

**Interviewer**: So basically, ask them what feels good and let them help build the routine?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that’s the big thing—they know their bodies best. Just let them have a say.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let’s talk bigger picture. How do you actually shift some of the bedtime power to the kids, but not end up with complete chaos? Especially as they get older.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, so—this is where collaboration comes in. Not chaos, collaboration.

**Interviewer**: So, what does that actually look like?

**Interviewee**: Family meeting! Sit everyone down, ask your kid what a good bedtime looks like for them, and how it feels when it’s... not great.

**Interviewer**: So, they help make the rules?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And the rewards too. When they help build the plan, they’re way more likely to stick with it. Way less pushback.

**Interviewer**: But you’re not giving up all the boundaries, right?

**Interviewee**: Nope, it’s just—sharing the process. You’re teaching them how to make good choices, not just following rules. Even if it’s not perfect, you’ll get more cooperation. Less drama.

**Interviewer**: I love that. More wisdom, less drama. I’ll take it.

**Interviewer**: So, you talk about making bedtime the… what was it? The "dessert of the day." I love that phrase. Can you share some of your favorite ways—like, actual strategies or little rituals—to help families make bedtime feel sweet? Even, you know, when the day’s been rough?

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally! I really believe bedtime can be something everyone looks forward to. Even on chaotic days. One of my favorites? Letting your kid ask any question they want—no matter how bizarre—right before lights out.

**Interviewer**: Wait, any question? That could get wild!

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And that’s the fun of it. It gives you a peek into what’s on their mind. Another one: sing a silly or totally made-up lullaby. Bonus points if you use their name in it.

**Interviewer**: Oh, my kid would love that. Does it have to rhyme?

**Interviewee**: Nope! The sillier, the better. And then there’s this thing called the I L.O.V.E. Y.O.U. touch lullaby—touch their nose, their toes, get them giggling. It’s all about those little moments.

**Interviewer**: That sounds adorable. Anything else?

**Interviewee**: Yeah! Share a few "I am safe, I am loved" statements together. Or just carve out five minutes for undistracted snuggles. Even if the whole day went off the rails, that little pocket of connection can turn it around.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s not about doing it perfectly, just about…

**Interviewee**: Being there. Making it consistent and real, not picture-perfect. Bedtime becomes a reset button for the family, not another thing to stress about.

**Interviewer**: I love that. You’ve mentioned this idea of "progress over perfection" a few times. But, what do you say to parents who just feel like… they’re failing if bedtime isn’t smooth every single night? How do they show themselves a little kindness, especially during those rough patches?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? Every parent feels like they’re blowing it, especially at bedtime. There’s just so much emotion flying around.

**Interviewer**: Right. Some nights are just… chaos.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And that’s normal. So instead of beating yourself up, notice the small wins—a faster tuck-in, one less meltdown, or just making it through the night.

**Interviewer**: Sometimes just surviving is the win, right?

**Interviewee**: Definitely. The goal isn’t some Instagram-perfect routine. Your kids need you present, not perfect. Give yourself the grace you’d offer a friend.

**Interviewer**: That’s such a relief to hear.

**Interviewer**: So, as we're winding down here, I'm curious—what do you think the long-term impact is of those intentional, connected bedtimes? Like, how do they really shape families, years down the line?

**Interviewee**: Oh, the impact is massive. Seriously, those bedtime moments? They stick with kids forever.

**Interviewer**: You mean, like, they actually remember them as adults?

**Interviewee**: Yes! It’s wild, but even grown-ups—remember Katie we mentioned earlier?—carry those bedtime memories with them, good or bad.

**Interviewer**: So if bedtime felt safe, and loving...?

**Interviewee**: Then that feeling of security and being valued—it just stays with you. It becomes part of how you see yourself, and how you feel about home.

**Interviewer**: Wow. So, it’s not just about getting kids to sleep.

**Interviewee**: Not at all! When we choose connection at bedtime, we’re actually breaking cycles, healing old wounds, and building something lasting.

**Interviewer**: Like those little rituals—stories, hugs, all that?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly. Those tiny acts of kindness, they echo for years. Honestly, that's the real legacy—not the sleep schedules, but the memories and the love that lasts.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
