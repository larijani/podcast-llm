## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about IE Short.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's get started. In your own words, how would you describe multichannel attribution? And, uh, why is everyone in marketing making such a fuss about it these days?

**Interviewee**: So, multichannel attribution—it's really just about figuring out which of your marketing touchpoints are actually moving the needle. You know, like, was it the email, the Facebook ad, or maybe even a visit to the store that pushed someone to buy.

**Interviewer**: Right, people don't just see one thing and buy anymore.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! They're bouncing all over the place—phone, laptop, store... So if marketers aren't tracking what's actually working, they're kinda just guessing with their budgets.

**Interviewer**: Flying blind, yeah. That sounds risky. So, what's tripping marketers up when they're trying to actually do this across every channel?

**Interviewee**: Oh, so many things. First off, you've got data silos—info's stuck in different departments or tools and won't talk to each other.

**Interviewer**: And then there’s the whole privacy thing, right? Tracking people without being—

**Interviewee**: —creepy! Yeah, that's the other big one. Plus, even if you have all the data, actually connecting the dots so it makes sense? That's a huge challenge, too.

**Interviewer**: So it's like, even when you do everything right, it still feels like a puzzle.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And the pieces don't always fit together nicely.

**Interviewer**: Alright, thanks for that! So, for everyone tuning in, what are they in for today? What’s the big takeaway about multichannel attribution by the end of this episode?

**Interviewee**: Great question. By the end, you’ll really understand what multichannel attribution is—how it works, why it’s such a big deal, and, more importantly, how you can use it yourself.

**Interviewer**: That sounds... like a lot! So we’re diving into the tech?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, we’ll break down the technical side, but don’t worry, we’ll keep it clear. We’ll also show how it connects online and offline touchpoints—and, trust me, we’ll talk about those privacy issues too.

**Interviewer**: Oh, the data headaches! I know a few listeners just perked up.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And I’ve got a real-world example lined up. Plus, you’ll pick up practical tips—whether you’re totally new to attribution or trying to fine-tune what you’re already doing.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s get into it. Can you walk us through a typical customer journey, in the world of multichannel attribution? What kinds of touchpoints are we looking at, and how on earth does attribution track them all?

**Interviewee**: Sure! Picture this: someone sees a display ad, maybe clicks on a search result, signs up for your email list—

**Interviewer**: —maybe they even pop into a physical store, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! All that, before they even buy something. Multichannel attribution tries to keep track of every single one of those moments, online and offline.

**Interviewer**: But how do you actually do that? Is it just magic?

**Interviewee**: Ha, I wish! It’s a lot of connecting the dots. You use things like cookies, email logins, loyalty cards—all to tie actions back to a unique person. Then, you stitch it all together.

**Interviewer**: So it’s like following a trail—digital breadcrumbs, and sometimes real ones.

**Interviewee**: That’s it! The idea is to see how every interaction, whether it’s a YouTube ad or a store coupon, played a role in the final sale.

**Interviewer**: So, that whole breadcrumb trail idea—honestly, it sounds almost sci-fi. How do you actually link someone’s online and offline actions together? I mean, people use different devices, they buy stuff in-store... How do you keep track of all that? What's the real secret behind making identity resolution work?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it does sound a bit like magic, right? But it’s not, it’s tech. Platforms like Epsilon’s CORE ID, they pull from all kinds of data—think email addresses, device fingerprints, loyalty cards, even hashed credit card info. So, say you open an email on your phone, then you shop on your laptop, and swipe your card in a store—

**Interviewer**: Wait, so CORE ID can actually tie all that back to you? Across every device and even in-store?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! That’s the whole idea. It builds a people-based ID, which is way more accurate than those old-school cookies. Marketers can finally follow the whole customer journey, whether it’s online or offline, and not lose track halfway through.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so once you’ve got all these touchpoints stitched together, what does the data actually look like? Is it just a giant spreadsheet? Or…?

**Interviewee**: Pretty much—it’s a massive dataset. Each row basically tells the story of one customer’s journey. So you get timestamps, channel info—like, was it an email open, a display ad impression, direct mail—

**Interviewer**: And these are all tied to the same person, right? Using that ID you mentioned?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly. And then you see the big finish—the conversion event. It’s all lined up: who did what, when, and on which channel. That way, marketers can run all sorts of attribution models. First click, last click, weighted, you name it.

**Interviewer**: So you can actually see which touchpoints moved the needle, not just guess?

**Interviewee**: Yep! And the data’s structured so you can slice it by channel, campaign, or even down to individual customer journeys. It’s a total game-changer for figuring out what’s really working.

**Interviewer**: So, earlier you mentioned CORE ID... but what about PeopleCloud? How does that fit in, and what does it really do for marketers, especially when it comes to attribution?

**Interviewee**: Oh, great question! So, think of CORE ID as the engine that matches identities, right?

**Interviewer**: Yeah, that's what you said.

**Interviewee**: Right, so PeopleCloud is kind of the command center. It's Epsilon’s own platform where all the data lives, the attribution models run, and—

**Interviewer**: Wait, so it actually stores everything and does the number crunching?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! It’s where you can score models, compare how different channels are performing, and even push audiences straight into your media buys. All in one spot.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not just a bunch of charts and stats then.

**Interviewee**: No, not at all. It's the glue, really—it turns all that data into something you can actually act on. Plus, it helps marketers keep those all-important match rates high, especially in online media.

**Interviewer**: Which is huge for accurate measurement, right?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, exactly. If you can’t match, you can’t measure.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s talk attribution models. Can you break down the difference between rule-based and model-based attribution? Like, maybe give an example of when you'd use each one?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, sure! So, rule-based is kind of like following a recipe. You’ve got set formulas—first click, last click, linear, and so on.

**Interviewer**: So, if someone clicks on an email first, the email gets all the credit?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. That’s first click. It’s really straightforward. But model-based attribution is a bit more... well, it’s smarter.

**Interviewer**: How so?

**Interviewee**: Because it uses algorithms and real data to figure out which touchpoints actually influenced someone—even if it’s not super obvious. So, if your sales cycle is, say, really complex, or you’re using a bunch of channels... model-based can reveal those hidden influences.

**Interviewer**: But if you just want a quick answer—

**Interviewee**: Rule-based is your friend. It’s less complicated, and honestly, way easier to explain when the boss wants a fast update.

**Interviewer**: So, let's dig into channel coverage for a second—attribution these days isn't just about, you know, email blasts or display ads anymore.

**Interviewee**: No, not even close. There're so many new channels in the mix now, right?

**Interviewer**: Totally. Like, how are marketers even tracking stuff like CTV and SMS now? That feels... kind of messy compared to the old ways.

**Interviewee**: It is messy! CTV—so, that's Connected TV—is wild. You're not dealing with cookies. You're looking at device-level IDs, or sometimes just household IPs, or accounts people are logged into on their smart TVs.

**Interviewer**: And SMS, that's different too, right?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, SMS is usually tied to your phone number, so you can match that back to a single profile, but only if your identity resolution is solid.

**Interviewer**: So you end up with email addresses, device IDs, phone numbers...

**Interviewee**: Exactly, and the tricky bit is pulling all those together into one profile. You really don't want to double-count or miss someone completely.

**Interviewer**: Or give the wrong channel the credit for the conversion.

**Interviewee**: Right! That's why platforms like CORE ID are so important—they stitch everything together. Someone might see an ad on TV, then grab their phone, then show up in a store—and you want to know that's all the same person.

**Interviewer**: But if your tagging isn't tight, it just falls apart, doesn't it?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. The data gets messy, fast, if your ID mapping slips anywhere along the way.

**Interviewer**: Alright, I'm curious—can we get specific? Walk me through that mortgage provider case study you mentioned earlier.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, for sure. So for them, the customer journey was all over the place. Direct mail, display ads, email pushes, even in-branch visits—people bounced between everything.

**Interviewer**: So, nobody was just clicking an email and signing up?

**Interviewee**: Nope. Most people started online, maybe clicked an email, then got a piece of direct mail, and finally closed the deal in person at a branch.

**Interviewer**: Sounds like every channel had its moment.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Attribution showed that channels worked together. Like, direct mail was huge for nudging people who were on the fence, while email was great for sparking that first bit of interest.

**Interviewer**: So if they hadn't put everything together, they would've missed how important each channel actually was?

**Interviewee**: Totally. Stitching all those touchpoints together is the only way they could see how much each one helped seal the deal.

**Interviewer**: Earlier, you mentioned privacy and data headaches. Can you, uh, dig a little deeper into how privacy regulations—like GDPR or CCPA—actually impact multichannel attribution? Especially when it comes to tracking and, you know, identity resolution?

**Interviewee**: Oh, yeah. Privacy is a massive landmine these days. With GDPR and CCPA, you can't just collect data or track people any way you want. You need—what's the word—consent. And not just that. People need clear ways to opt out, and companies have to handle data super carefully.

**Interviewer**: So, it's not as simple as just tossing everything into a database and calling it a day.

**Interviewee**: Not even close! You need really tight controls for identity resolution. We're talking hashed IDs, as little personal info as possible, and you have to be really transparent.

**Interviewer**: And if you get it wrong—

**Interviewee**: It's not just a slap on the wrist. We're talking big fines, lawsuits, people losing trust in your brand. Marketers have to find this, uh, balance: offering personalization while respecting privacy.

**Interviewer**: So, attribution solutions have to be—

**Interviewee**: Privacy-by-design. Right from the start. It can't be an afterthought. It's this constant tightrope walk, and just when you think you've got it sorted, the rules change again.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so let's say you've managed to gather all this data and run your attribution models. How do dashboards actually help marketers make sense of everything?

**Interviewee**: Dashboards are where everything just clicks. You fire up something like Tableau, and suddenly you can compare how different attribution models score each channel.

**Interviewer**: You mean like, rule-based versus model-based attribution?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And you can break it down by customer segments—like new prospects versus existing customers—or zero in on a particular campaign.

**Interviewer**: So, what's the real value? What kind of insights do you actually get?

**Interviewee**: The magic is, you turn this spaghetti mess of data into real, actionable insights. Like, 'Hey, email's driving way more conversions than we thought,' or, 'CTV is absolutely crushing it with new prospects.'

**Interviewer**: Which means—

**Interviewee**: You can shift your budget smarter, target better, and actually have proof to show the boss. Without a dashboard, honestly, it just feels like you're swimming in raw data with no life raft.

**Interviewer**: So, hey, before we wrap up, if you look back at everything we’ve talked about today... what would you say are the top, I don’t know, two or three takeaways for marketers who—who want to really nail attribution in this multichannel world?

**Interviewee**: Oof, big question! Well, first thing—get your identity resolution right. If you can't connect online with offline touchpoints, then honestly, nothing else matters.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, because you end up missing half the story, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And then, don’t just pick one attribution model and call it a day. Try comparing rule-based and model-based approaches. Sometimes, there’s hidden value you’d totally miss otherwise.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not a one-size-fits-all kinda deal.

**Interviewee**: Not at all! And third—bake privacy into everything you do. Seriously, if you skip that, you risk trust and compliance. Attribution only works if your data—and your ethics—are solid.

**Interviewer**: That’s a great point. And for someone who’s new to all this—maybe just getting started with multichannel attribution—where do they even begin? Like, what should their first steps be?

**Interviewee**: I’d say, keep it simple to start. Run some discovery sessions—figure out your business goals. What do you actually want to measure?

**Interviewer**: So, set your intentions first, basically.

**Interviewee**: Right. Then, audit your data. Make sure you know which channels you’re tracking—and that your tagging is actually working. No point building dashboards on broken data!

**Interviewer**: Ha, yeah, that would be a nightmare.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. After that, pick a simple rule-based model to test, automate your data flow where you can, and get some sort of dashboard up—just for those quick wins.

**Interviewer**: And then, just keep iterating from there?

**Interviewee**: Yep! Iterate, test, fix what’s broken, and gradually build out from there. That’s how you get real traction.

**Interviewer**: So, looking ahead—how do you think attribution is going to change? You know, with all these new channels popping up and privacy rules getting stricter.

**Interviewee**: Oh, it’s only going to get messier, isn’t it? I mean, look at all the new places ads are showing up. Voice assistants, your car’s dashboard, even your fridge might start selling you stuff soon.

**Interviewer**: Wait, my fridge? Are you serious?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, really! IoT devices are everywhere. And each one is another data source to try and track.

**Interviewer**: But with privacy getting, you know, tighter—how do you even keep up?

**Interviewee**: That’s the tricky part. Everything’s got to be privacy-by-design now. You can’t tack it on later.

**Interviewer**: So what’s the next big thing, then? For measurement?

**Interviewee**: Honestly? AI-driven, real-time attribution. Models that adjust themselves as things happen—not just spitting out old reports.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s not just about what happened last quarter…

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It’s about knowing what’s happening now, and—

**Interviewer**: —what you should do next. Right?

**Interviewee**: Yes! Marketers have to get ready for that kind of measurement. It’s a whole new ballgame.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
