## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about Ally Pally.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let's get started—I've been hearing this term everywhere: 'Ally Pally.' What does it mean in marketing attribution, and why is everyone suddenly talking about it?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, 'Ally Pally'—it's got a nice ring to it, right? So, it's actually short for 'allied pathways.' Basically, it's about connecting every single customer touchpoint—online, offline, in-app, even stuff like direct mail.

**Interviewer**: So, it's not just digital?

**Interviewee**: Nope, far from it. Marketers used to look at channels separately, but now, with all this talk about people-based attribution, they want the full picture. No more siloed data.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, makes sense. But what's changed? Why now?

**Interviewee**: Well, new tech—like Epsilon's CORE ID—lets you actually stitch together all those interactions. Suddenly, you can see which channels are pulling their weight and which ones... not so much.

**Interviewer**: So, it's like the end of guesswork?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And that's why everyone's buzzing about it. It's the antidote to wasted spend and flying blind.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so let's dig a little deeper. Why does getting attribution right matter so much for marketers today? What's at risk if you don't connect all those dots?

**Interviewee**: If you don't get attribution right, you're basically tossing your budget into the wind—hoping something lands. Customers are jumping between devices and platforms all the time.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, it's chaos out there.

**Interviewee**: Total chaos! If you can't connect those touchpoints, you risk double-counting, missing key steps, or giving the wrong channel all the credit.

**Interviewer**: Which means... wasted money?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Wasted budget, missed chances, and it's almost impossible to personalize. Plus, try explaining ROI to your boss when the data's a mess.

**Interviewer**: So, bad attribution just equals lost growth.

**Interviewee**: And no marketer wants that, especially now.

**Interviewer**: So, can you walk me through how Ally Pally actually connects online and offline events? I mean, what does that really look like, day-to-day?

**Interviewee**: Sure, yeah, let's dive in. So, Ally Pally—especially when it's powered by something like Epsilon’s CORE ID—kinda acts as the glue holding all your channels together. Imagine someone gets a direct mailer at home, then later, they're scrolling through an email on their phone, and finally—they Google your brand and end up buying something in-store.

**Interviewer**: So, all those touchpoints are usually... just floating around separately, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Traditionally, those moments would be trapped in their own little silos. You'd never know it was the same person. But now, with people-based ID tech, every single one of those interactions gets stitched together into one profile.

**Interviewer**: So you’re saying: onboarding offline data, tagging digital stuff, and then—what—linking it all up?

**Interviewee**: Yep, that’s it. You bring in offline data—like loyalty card swipes, CRM lists, whatever—and then tag digital interactions. The tech resolves it all into a single, unified view of the customer.

**Interviewer**: Which means marketers can finally see the whole journey? Like, how online drives offline and vice versa?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It’s a game-changer for attribution. Suddenly you can see what’s really working, not just guess.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so you called people-based IDs the "glue"—why are they such a big deal compared to cookies or all those channel-specific IDs? Can you give me an example of the difference?

**Interviewee**: Oh, for sure. Cookies, honestly, they're kind of... running out of time. They only work on a single device or browser, and with all the privacy changes, it's getting worse. But people-based IDs? They tie everything back to the actual person—across devices, browsers, even offline actions.

**Interviewer**: So if I start shopping at work, get retargeted on my phone, and then actually buy in-store—

**Interviewee**: —that's all connected. You're not just counting clicks anymore. You’re actually seeing how every touchpoint leads to conversion.

**Interviewer**: So marketers can finally personalize at scale, stop wasting impressions, and know where to give credit?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It's the difference between guessing... and actually knowing what's driving results.

**Interviewer**: Hey, let's talk about channel coverage for a second—what kinds of channels can Ally Pally actually connect and measure?

**Interviewee**: You mean, like, is it really multi-channel, or just the usual suspects?

**Interviewer**: Yeah, I mean, is it just digital, or—

**Interviewee**: Oh, way more than just digital! Sure, you get display, video, paid search, email, all the classics. But it goes deeper—mobile in-app, desktop, even those external programmatic buys through DSPs like Yahoo or The Trade Desk.

**Interviewer**: Wait, you can actually track those? Through the DSPs?

**Interviewee**: Yep. And that's not all. Offline channels, too—think in-store purchases, direct mail, even call center events, as long as you've got the right tags or data feeds set up.

**Interviewer**: Wow, so not just the usual online stuff. Anything people tend to overlook?

**Interviewee**: CTV—connected TV—is huge right now, but you'd be surprised how often it's ignored. Oh, and third-party browsing data can help fill in the gaps, too.

**Interviewer**: So, basically, wherever the customer shows up—Ally Pally can measure it?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. The whole point is to cover every touchpoint, not just the obvious ones. It's wild, honestly, how many brands still forget about things like direct mail or in-store. But if you set up the data right, it's all fair game.

**Interviewer**: Alright, shifting gears a bit—can we dig into attribution methods? What's the difference between rule-based and model-based? And when should a marketer pick one over the other?

**Interviewee**: Oh, this is the heart of the whole measurement thing! So, rule-based attribution—that's where you set the rules yourself. Last-click, first-click, linear—basically, you decide how to give credit for conversions.

**Interviewer**: Like, 'all the credit goes to the final touch,' or 'let's split it evenly'? That kind of thing?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It's simple, easy to set up, and great if your customer journey isn't too complicated or if you want total transparency.

**Interviewer**: But what if your journey is messy—lots of touchpoints?

**Interviewee**: That's where model-based attribution comes in. It uses stats and machine learning to figure out which touchpoints actually moved the needle. Super nuanced, can handle all those messy, multi-channel paths.

**Interviewer**: But I guess it's not as transparent?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it can feel like a black box for some folks, and it needs more data, too. But if you're running lots of channels and have complex journeys, it's a game-changer.

**Interviewer**: So, small brands or simple funnels—

**Interviewee**: Rule-based works fine. But if you've got scale and complexity, seriously consider model-based. The trick is really knowing your data—and what you're trying to achieve.

**Interviewer**: So, could you walk us through how Ally Pally attribution played out for that mortgage provider? Like... what did the cross-channel journey actually look like?

**Interviewee**: Ah, yeah, this one's a classic. The mortgage provider had leads flying in from all over—paid search, display ads, direct mail, and even call centers. It was a real mix.

**Interviewer**: So, people were seeing ads everywhere, then?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And with Epsilon’s CORE ID, the team could finally see how it all connected. Picture this: someone sees a CTV ad, then they pull out their phone to Google mortgage rates, click on a paid search ad—

**Interviewer**: And then they call in, right?

**Interviewee**: Yeah! They'd call a rep, ask a bunch of questions, and only after that would they apply online. It wasn't a straight line at all.

**Interviewer**: So, not just one channel doing all the work?

**Interviewee**: Right, most conversions actually touched three or more channels. The big surprise was just how much display and CTV mattered early on, while call centers closed the deal.

**Interviewer**: So, they had to rethink their spend, I guess?

**Interviewee**: They did. They shifted budgets, cut wasted impressions, and saw a big jump in ROI. It really changed their whole approach to marketing efficiency.

**Interviewer**: Makes sense. Now with all that data coming in from everywhere, how does Ally Pally actually help with personalization and targeting? I mean, can you give us, like, a concrete example?

**Interviewee**: For sure. This is where Ally Pally gets interesting. By unifying online and offline data under one ID, you get this complete picture of each customer’s journey.

**Interviewer**: So, you can see if someone opens an email, ignores an ad, visits the site... all of that?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And then, instead of sending everyone the same generic message, you tailor what they see—and when they see it—based on their actual behavior.

**Interviewer**: Got an example?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, say the data shows someone always converts after seeing a CTV ad. You can put more CTV in front of that segment. Or if they never click emails but always walk into a branch—

**Interviewer**: You focus your spend on in-store, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It’s not just about targeting, it’s about orchestrating a personal experience. That’s how you move from 'spray and pray' to real, one-to-one marketing.

**Interviewer**: So, once you’ve got these attribution insights... how do you actually use them to maximize ROI?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that’s where it gets interesting, right? The insights are one thing, but what you do next—that’s the magic.

**Interviewer**: So, what’s the first thing you’d do?

**Interviewee**: I’d say, first—move your budget. Shift it toward what’s genuinely working. Maybe you dig in and realize, hey, CTV or display is actually crushing it, way more than you assumed.

**Interviewer**: So you’d double down on those channels?

**Interviewee**: Exactly, and trim spend where things aren’t performing. It’s about letting the data guide your wallet.

**Interviewer**: And beyond budget—what else?

**Interviewee**: Personalize your messaging. If you know someone converted offline, maybe send them a direct mail follow-up. Or retarget website visitors with special offers tailored just for them.

**Interviewer**: Ah, so not just blasting everyone with the same thing.

**Interviewee**: Right, and—oh!—don’t forget about stopping wasted impressions. If someone’s already bought, you don’t need to keep showing them ads, right?

**Interviewer**: Yeah, that’s just money down the drain.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. So it’s all about spending smarter, targeting sharper, and always testing what works. Squeeze every drop out of your budget.

**Interviewer**: Alright, so looking back at all these Ally Pally strategies... what would you say are the top two or three lessons marketers should take away if they want to really nail attribution in 2024?

**Interviewee**: First, do not sleep on people-based identity. If you’re stuck with cookies or old channel IDs, you’re missing, like, half the picture.

**Interviewer**: So you’re saying get beyond just digital footprints?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Second, you’ve got to unify your data. Pull it all together—online, offline, CTV, call center, everything. That’s what Ally Pally does best.

**Interviewer**: And third?

**Interviewee**: Be flexible with your attribution models. Start simple if you need to, but don’t be afraid to get more sophisticated as you go. The right model can show you opportunities you’d never spot otherwise.

**Interviewer**: So, keep evolving—don’t get stuck in one way of doing things.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And, honestly, the most important thing: act on what you learn. Keep testing, keep shifting, keep personalizing. Attribution’s only useful if you actually do something with it.

**Interviewer**: So, let's say a marketer is totally new to this Ally Pally-style attribution stuff... Where do they actually start? What's the first real step you'd tell them to take?

**Interviewee**: First thing? Do a discovery session. I mean, actually sit down and figure out—what are your business goals? What channels are you running? And, most people forget this part—what does your data look like right now?

**Interviewer**: People skip that, don't they? They just jump right in.

**Interviewee**: All the time! They want to play with fancy attribution models, but their basic tagging is a mess, or they're not tracking half the channels. So, really, you need to make sure you're capturing the right data—online, offline, even site behavior.

**Interviewer**: And tying it back to people, not just devices, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. If you can't connect it all to a person, you can't really tell what's working.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so what are the big mistakes folks make early on?

**Interviewee**: Messy data—number one. Or, the teams aren't actually aligned on what 'success' means. Or, they try to do everything at once. You have to start small. Get your foundation right.

**Interviewer**: So focus first, build the basics, then expand once things are working.

**Interviewee**: That's it. Nail the fundamentals, and then you can get fancy.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
