## Script

**Interviewer**: Welcome to Podcast LLM. Today we've invited an expert to talk about Sleep 6.

**Interviewer**: Alright, to start us off, what got you so interested in sleep—especially sleep for kids and families? I mean, why does this topic matter so much right now?

**Interviewee**: Oh, where do I even begin? Honestly, it all started with what I was seeing in my work as an occupational therapist. Every other day, I’d meet these totally worn-out parents, and their kids would be just as wiped out—everyone cranky, everything felt like a battle.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, I can imagine. Tired kids, tired parents—must be chaos.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And when I started looking into it, the research just blew me away. Sleep isn’t just something nice—it’s as important as food or, you know, love. It’s the base of everything.

**Interviewer**: So, you’re saying if a family’s not sleeping well, it’s kind of like... everything else gets harder?

**Interviewee**: Totally. Sleep shapes how kids learn, how they get along with siblings, even how they bounce back from getting sick. And today, with all the screens and busy schedules, sleep’s the first thing that gets cut.

**Interviewer**: Right, it’s always the thing that goes first.

**Interviewee**: And helping families get it back? It can honestly change everything for them.

**Interviewer**: So, you mentioned that poor sleep can really mess with family life. Can you give us some real-life examples—how does it show up? What are those ripple effects you see all the time?

**Interviewee**: Oh, there are so many. First, the moodiness. Kids get cranky, little things turn into huge arguments. You ask them to put on socks and suddenly it’s World War III.

**Interviewer**: Just over socks?

**Interviewee**: Yep, even socks! And then you start seeing them get sick more often, or their teachers might say they can’t focus. They’re just not themselves when they’re tired.

**Interviewer**: And I bet it’s not just the kids who feel it.

**Interviewee**: Nope, parents get dragged into it too. If the kids aren’t sleeping, you’re not sleeping. Suddenly you’re guzzling coffee, snapping at your partner, forgetting where you put your keys.

**Interviewer**: Sounds like a downward spiral.

**Interviewee**: It really is. The whole family starts to feel disconnected, and even simple things just feel hard. Sleep touches everything—your health, your patience, even how safe you feel at home.

**Interviewer**: So it’s not just about feeling tired—it’s about the whole family’s wellbeing.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. That’s why I’m so passionate about it.

**Interviewer**: You know, a lot of parents hear 'cry it out' and just assume that's the go-to fix for bedtime drama.

**Interviewee**: Yeah, they do. But honestly, it’s way more complicated than that.

**Interviewer**: So your approach—it's not just 'cry it out and hope for the best,' right?

**Interviewee**: Right! 'Cry it out' is just one tool, and it doesn’t fit every family. Or every kid.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, so what are the struggles you see most often at bedtime?

**Interviewee**: Oh, there are a few classics. You’ve got the kids who just can’t wind down—little ones literally bouncing off the walls at, like, 8:30.

**Interviewee**: Or older kids who suddenly decide bedtime is the perfect time to have deep, philosophical chats.

**Interviewer**: Oh, the bedtime philosophers! My favorite.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And then you’ve got kids who get really anxious when it’s time to be alone. Or the super-curious ones who just can’t stand the idea they might miss something fun.

**Interviewer**: So, 'cry it out' might stop the noise for a night, but it doesn’t really solve the problem?

**Interviewee**: That’s the thing. It might end the battle for now, but it doesn’t get to the root—like anxiety, sensory stuff, or just wanting more connection.

**Interviewee**: And honestly, for some parents, hearing their child cry alone feels totally wrong. It can even hurt the trust between them.

**Interviewee**: The real trick is to figure out why your kid is struggling. Sometimes it’s about calming their nervous system, sometimes it’s helping them feel safe, and sometimes the whole family needs a new routine.

**Interviewer**: So, there’s never just one right answer.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And honestly, that’s a good thing! Every family gets to find what works for them.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s go back to basics for a second. How much sleep do kids really need at different ages? And, I mean, are there signs they’re not getting enough—even if they’re not just yawning constantly?

**Interviewee**: Love this question! Sleep needs shift as kids grow, but, roughly: toddlers need about 11 to 14 hours in 24, preschoolers about 10 to 13, school-aged kids 9 to 12, and teens 8 to 10.

**Interviewer**: I bet most teens don’t get anywhere near that.

**Interviewee**: Not even close. But here’s the tricky part—tired kids don’t always look sleepy. Sometimes, they get hyper, or extra clumsy—like their body’s fighting to stay awake.

**Interviewee**: Or they’re just cranky, or can’t focus, or they get sick more often.

**Interviewee**: Little things turn into big arguments. Or, if your kid suddenly can’t handle transitions or play by themselves, it could be a sleep thing.

**Interviewer**: So, if you see those signs, it’s worth checking if sleep is the missing piece.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. It’s not always obvious, but it makes a huge difference.

**Interviewer**: So, you’ve talked about these, uh, "four pillars" for better sleep—body, mind, heart, and spirit. Can you walk me through what each one really means? And how do they all work together, you know, to help families get past those quick fixes that never seem to last?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, totally. So, the four pillars—they’re about seeing sleep as, well, more than just getting your body into bed and closing your eyes.

**Interviewer**: It’s not just about the physical part, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! The first pillar, BODY, is all about getting the nervous system to slow down. That might mean dimming the lights, taking a warm bath—just helping the body start to relax.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s like, setting the scene physically.

**Interviewee**: Right. Then, there’s MIND. A lot of kids have trouble switching off their thoughts, so you might try a 'worry box' or some gentle breathing. It’s about calming their minds, not just their bodies.

**Interviewer**: That makes sense. And HEART?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, HEART is all about connection. Kids need to feel safe at night—so maybe that’s snuggles, stories, or just a few minutes where you’re totally present with them.

**Interviewer**: I guess that’s the part that helps them feel, you know, secure and loved.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. And then there’s SPIRIT. That’s about comfort and peace—could be bedtime prayers, a favorite lullaby, or just a ritual that makes the night feel special. Whatever gives them a sense of calm and safety.

**Interviewer**: So, when you look at all four together, it’s not just about winning another bedtime battle.

**Interviewee**: Right! You’re actually building real habits and trust that stick with them, even as they grow up.

**Interviewer**: Let’s, uh, zoom in on the first pillar—BODY. What are some of your favorite ways you’ve seen families help those 'live wire' kids wind down before bed? You know, the ones who seem to never run out of energy?

**Interviewee**: Oh, those kids! I know them well—always bouncing, always on the move.

**Interviewer**: The ones who are still doing cartwheels at 8:30.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. For them, routine is everything. If bedtime feels unpredictable, their bodies just stay amped up. So, start with dimming the lights, maybe some quiet activities—like puzzles or drawing, or reading together. Just things that signal it’s time to slow down.

**Interviewer**: What about baths? Or those, uh, weighted blankets?

**Interviewee**: Yes! A warm bath (not too hot), a back rub, or gentle deep pressure—those can work wonders. Weighted blankets, too, for some kids. And honestly, keeping the room cool really helps. Overheating wakes the body right up.

**Interviewer**: Oh, and screens. Those are a no-go, right?

**Interviewee**: Screens after dinner? Yeah, they’re the enemy. The blue light just wakes up their brains. So, it’s really about layering calm, rhythmic cues so their bodies finally get the message: it’s time to rest.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so—let's talk about the mind for a second. At bedtime, even if a kid’s body is totally calm, their brain can still be... racing, right? You know, worries, nighttime fears, all that. What can parents actually do to help kids settle those busy thoughts?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that’s a huge one. You can have the most relaxed kid physically, but if their mind is doing gymnastics—sleep just isn’t happening. One thing I love is the idea of a “worry box.”

**Interviewer**: A worry box? What’s that?

**Interviewee**: So, your child writes down or draws what’s bugging them, pops it into the box, and you agree to look at it together in the morning. That act of putting the worry away—physically—it can really help kids feel like, okay, I can leave this alone for the night.

**Interviewer**: That’s clever. It’s almost like... giving their worries a bedtime, too.

**Interviewee**: Exactly! And then there’s gentle breathing, or guided meditations—there are some awesome ones for kids online. Those can really help settle their thoughts.

**Interviewer**: What about kids who just need to do something with their hands?

**Interviewee**: Oh, absolutely. Quiet activities, like doodling, flipping through a book, or even fiddling with a fidget toy in bed—those can be really soothing. It’s like you’re keeping their hands busy so their mind can take a break.

**Interviewer**: I love that. And bedtime chats—do they help?

**Interviewee**: So much! Just a simple, consistent chat before lights out, where you talk through any fears or ‘what ifs’—that makes a kid feel heard. It’s not just ‘go to sleep, ignore your worries’—it’s about giving them tools to handle those nighttime thoughts.

**Interviewer**: Alright, now let’s talk about the HEART pillar. Why is connection and security at bedtime so—well, essential? And what are a couple of ways parents can help their kids feel safe, even after a rough day?

**Interviewee**: Honestly, connection is the secret sauce for sleep. Kids need to feel safe before they can really drift off. If they’re picking up on stress, or they’re not sure where they stand with you, their brain just... won’t let them rest.

**Interviewer**: So, what can parents actually do in the moment?

**Interviewee**: Even tiny things—like a real hug, looking your child in the eye, or saying, ‘I love you no matter what’—those matter so much. One of my favorites is a quick ‘special time’ ritual. Share something you liked about the day, or make up a silly handshake just for bedtime.

**Interviewer**: And if the day’s been a total disaster?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that happens! Just being honest—‘Today was rough, but I’m always here for you’—can be the most reassuring thing you say all night. It’s not about getting everything perfect; it’s about showing up, even when things are messy.

**Interviewer**: So, let's dive into the SPIRIT pillar. I’m really curious—how can parents actually use things like faith, prayer, or... even just little rituals, to help kids feel safe and calm at bedtime? Especially if their kids get really nervous at night?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that's a great question. Bedtime is honestly the perfect moment for some spiritual connection—especially when kids are feeling anxious.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, it almost feels like, at night, those worries get even bigger, right?

**Interviewee**: Exactly! Even if you’re not super religious, just having a pause—a moment to breathe together, or to share something that feels bigger than all the day’s stress—can totally shift the mood.

**Interviewer**: So, you mean, it doesn’t have to be a big formal prayer or anything?

**Interviewee**: Not at all. I mean, for families who are faith-based, sure, a bedtime prayer or reading something comforting—a Bible verse, maybe Deuteronomy 6:5-7, or James 1:17—can really remind kids they’re safe and loved.

**Interviewer**: But for everyone else?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, for anyone, really, even a simple ritual helps. Singing a lullaby, lighting a candle, or just saying one thing you’re grateful for before bed. Those little things can make a huge difference.

**Interviewer**: So, it’s about helping kids feel... held, I guess? Not just by their parents, but by something bigger?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. That sense of spiritual safety—it helps them practice what I call 'peaceful waiting.' It gives them courage to face those nighttime fears, even in the dark.

**Interviewer**: Alright, let’s get a bit more practical. What about when bedtime just... falls apart? Like, if a kid hates pajamas, or every little noise bothers them, or they keep waking up in the middle of the night—what do you do?

**Interviewee**: Oh, that’s the real detective work! With sensory stuff, it’s all about noticing patterns—maybe your kid always fights certain pajamas, or hates those scratchy tags, or needs their blanket just so.

**Interviewer**: So you don’t just brush it off or tell them to deal with it?

**Interviewee**: No way. Actually, validating it is key. Say something like, 'Your body’s kind of picky, and that’s totally okay!' Then let them pick their softest clothes, try a sound machine if little noises are a problem, adjust the lights—whatever helps.

**Interviewer**: And what if baths just make them wild instead of sleepy?

**Interviewee**: Oh, if baths hype them up? Just move them to the morning! No rule says baths have to be right before bed.

**Interviewer**: What about those kids who keep waking up at night?

**Interviewee**: First, check if they’re uncomfortable or anxious. Stay calm—keep your response boring and predictable. Sometimes, that’s all they need to settle.

**Interviewer**: And those power struggles—when everything becomes a negotiation?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, power struggles usually mean the kid wants some control. Offer choices—like, 'Do you want to read one book, or two?' And honestly, notice your own stress, too. Kids can feel when we’re tense.

**Interviewer**: Oh, for sure! Sometimes just saying 'We’re a team' helps, right?

**Interviewee**: Absolutely. Every kid is a different puzzle, but with some curiosity—and a lot of empathy—you really can crack the code.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so once families have the basics down—like, routines and all that—how do parents actually help their kids take charge of their own sleep? Especially as they get older, you know? How can you build that independence… but not just leave them on their own or, you know, micromanage everything?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, that's a great question. I think there’s this sweet spot, right? You want to give kids a say, but you also want to keep a little structure in place.

**Interviewer**: A balance, yeah?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. For older kids, I love bringing them into the conversation. Ask them—what helps them feel rested? What makes bedtime tough? I know a family who actually held a 'bedtime brainstorming meeting.'

**Interviewer**: A meeting? That’s hilarious. Did it work?

**Interviewee**: It totally did! The kids came up with their own ideas—and because they felt heard, they were way more into the new routine.

**Interviewer**: So, like, let them pick their own wind-down music, or the order of steps?

**Interviewee**: Yes, exactly! Let them personalize things. Instead of just ordering them around, say, 'How could we make tomorrow morning easier?' Collaborate, you know?

**Interviewer**: But you’re not just handing over everything, right?

**Interviewee**: No, not at all. It’s not about dumping all the responsibility, but giving them little bits of control—so they start building their own sleep wisdom as they grow.

**Interviewer**: Okay, so you’ve shared so many good tips—

**Interviewee**: Thank you.

**Interviewer**: —but if you had to sum it all up, what does it actually look like when bedtime becomes… I think you called it the 'dessert to your day'? Can you paint that picture for us—what does that feel like, for both kids and parents?

**Interviewee**: Oh, I love that question. So, when bedtime is the 'dessert,' it’s not this dreaded battle or a checklist to slog through.

**Interviewer**: It’s the best part?

**Interviewee**: Yeah! It’s honestly the sweetest part. You’ve got dim lights, soft voices, maybe some music or a story. Everybody’s winding down together after a long day.

**Interviewer**: So, the kids actually look forward to it?

**Interviewee**: They do! Kids get excited for the little rituals—maybe it’s a funny handshake, or sharing a high and a low from the day, or snuggling with a favorite stuffed animal.

**Interviewer**: And parents? What’s in it for them?

**Interviewee**: Parents finally get to exhale. There’s no bracing for battle. There’s laughter, maybe even a few confessions, and you end the day on a loving note—even if it was a wild one.

**Interviewer**: So, bedtime becomes a safe space. Not just something to get through.

**Interviewee**: That’s it. It’s something everyone craves, not just survives.

**Interviewer**: So, you’ve talked before about how bedtime routines can really stick with us—sometimes in good ways, sometimes not so much. I’m curious, in your work, what kind of long-term changes have you seen when families go from those stressful bedtimes to, you know, more connected ones? Any moments that stand out?

**Interviewee**: Oh, totally. The impact can be huge—and honestly, sometimes parents don’t realize it until, like, years later. I’ve seen families where bedtime used to mean yelling or tears. Even punishments, right? And those memories... they can really hang around. They can make kids—and even parents—dread bedtime for years.

**Interviewer**: Yeah, it’s like those feelings get passed down, even if no one means for it to happen.

**Interviewee**: Exactly. I remember this one mom, Katie. She realized her own bedtime anxiety—like, as an adult—came from her childhood. Her mom was always stressed, angry about sleep, and it just... sort of stuck.

**Interviewer**: Wow, so it’s not just about the kids now, it’s about how those memories shape them later, too.

**Interviewee**: Yes! But here’s the thing—when families make the change, it’s a total transformation. Suddenly, kids actually want to go to bed. I’ve seen siblings who used to fight now help each other pick out pajamas or brush teeth. It’s wild.

**Interviewer**: So the energy in the house just shifts?

**Interviewee**: Yeah, it’s like night and day. Parents tell me their kids start opening up—you know, sharing stuff about their day or worries, just because they know bedtime is a safe moment. And years later, those routines turn into really warm memories.

**Interviewer**: That’s powerful. And that feeling of safety sticks, even when they’re teens or adults?

**Interviewee**: Totally. That deep sense of connection... it lasts. And honestly? It’s never too late. You can always rewrite those bedtime stories.

**Interviewer**: So, let’s say there’s a parent listening right now who just feels... stuck. Like bedtime is a total mess and nothing’s working. What would you say to them? Is it really possible to turn things around?

**Interviewee**: I’d say—first, you are so not alone. So many families struggle with this. And just because you’re stuck now, it doesn’t mean you can’t change things.

**Interviewer**: Even if every night feels like a disaster?

**Interviewee**: Exactly. Change can be tiny. Like, just taking a breath before you start bedtime, or shifting your goal from 'perfect sleep' to just having a calm moment together. I worked with a mom—Melanie—who had nightly power struggles. But once she changed her approach, things really softened.

**Interviewer**: So, it doesn’t have to be a huge overhaul all at once.

**Interviewee**: Not at all! And honestly? Every night you get a new shot. If last night was rough, tonight’s a fresh start. No shame in it. Progress is messy, but it’s real. Give yourself grace. That’s half the battle.

**Interviewer**: One night at a time.

**Interviewee**: That’s it. You’ve got this.

**Interviewer**: That's all for today. Thank you for listening to Podcast LLM. See you next time when we'll talk about whatever you want.
